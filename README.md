![n8n.io - Workflow Automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n8n-io/n8n/master/assets/n8n-logo.png)

n8n is an extendable workflow automation tool. With a [fair-code](http://faircode.io) distribution model, n8n will always have visible source code, be available to self-host, and allow you to add your own custom functions, logic and apps. n8n's node-based approach makes it highly versatile, enabling you to connect anything to everything.

## n8n desktop

The n8n desktop app is the fastest way to try n8n on Windows or Mac computers (support for Linux is coming soon). Download the app from the link below:

[Download for Windows](https://DOWNLOADLINK-WINDOWS)
[Download for macOS](https://DOWNLOADLINK-MAC)

**Note:** The app is currently in beta and does not support a few nodes. You can read more about it [here](https://GITHUB-README-LINK).

::: tip 💡 Keep in mind
If you have already installed n8n locally via `npm`, the desktop app will connect to the existing `sqlite` database.

### FAQs

### What does n8n mean and how do you pronounce it?

**Short answer:** It means "nodemation" and it is pronounced as n-eight-n.

**Long answer:** "I get that question quite often (more often than I expected)
so I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a
good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the
good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose
nodemation. 'node-' in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses
Node.js and '-mation' for 'automation' which is what the project is supposed to help with.
However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing
something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on
'n8n'." - **Jan Oberhauser, Founder and CEO, n8n.io**
