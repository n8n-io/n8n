```bash
npx n8n
```

This will:
1. Download and start n8n automatically
2. Open your browser to http://localhost:5678

**Note**: For permanent installation, use npm:
```bash
npm install n8n -g
n8n start
```

### Option 2: Run with Docker (Recommended for Production)

1. Create a persistent data volume:
```bash
docker volume create n8n_data
```

2. Start n8n container:
```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  --name n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

3. Access the editor at http://localhost:5678

**To run in background (detached mode)**:
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

## What does n8n mean?

**Short answer:** It means "nodemation" and is pronounced as n-eight-n.

**Long answer:** "I get that question quite often (more often than I expected) so I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose nodemation. 'node-' in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses Node.js and '-mation' for 'automation' which is what the project is supposed to help with. However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on 'n8n'." - **Jan Oberhauser, Founder and CEO, n8n.io**
