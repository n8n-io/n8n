    "description": "This workflow **enriches new Pipedrive organization's data by adding a note to the organization object in Pipedrive**. It assumes there is a custom \"website\" field in your Pipedrive setup, as data will be scraped from this website to generate a note using OpenAI. Then, a notification is sent in Slack.\n\n## ⚠️ Disclaimer\n**This workflow uses a scraping API. Before using it, ensure you comply with the regulations regarding web scraping in your country or state**.\n\n## Important Notes\n- The **OpenAI model used is GPT-4o**, chosen for its large input token capacity. However, it is not the cheapest model if cost is very important to you.\n\n- The system prompt in the OpenAI Node generates output with relevant information, but feel free to improve or **modify it according to your needs**.\n\n## **How It Works**\n\n### Node 1: `Pipedrive Trigger - An Organization is Created`\nThis is the trigger of the workflow. When **an organization object is created in Pipedrive**, this node is triggered and retrieves the data. **Make sure you have a \"website\" custom field in Pipedrive** (the name of the field in the n8n node will appear as a random ID and not with the Pipedrive custom field name).\n\n### Node 2: `ScrapingBee - Get Organization's Website's Homepage Content`\nThis node **scrapes the content** from the URL of the website associated with the **Pipedrive Organization** created in Node 1. The workflow uses the [ScrapingBee](https://www.scrapingbee.com/) API, but **you can use any preferred API or simply the HTTP request node in n8n**.\n\n### Node 3: `OpenAI - Message GPT-4o with Scraped Data`\nThis node sends HTML-scraped data from the previous node to the **OpenAI GPT-4o model**. The system prompt instructs the model to **extract company data**, such as products or services offered and competitors (if known by the model), and format it as HTML for optimal use in a Pipedrive Note.\n\n### Node 4: `Pipedrive - Create a Note with OpenAI Output`\nThis node **adds a Note to the Organization created in Pipedrive** using the OpenAI node output. The Note will include the company description, target market, selling products, and competitors (if GPT-4o was able to determine them).\n\n### Node 5 & 6: `HTML To Markdown` & `Code - Markdown to Slack Markdown`\nThese two nodes **format the HTML output to Slack Markdown**.\n\nThe Note created in Pipedrive is in HTML format, **as specified by the System Prompt of the OpenAI Node**. To send it to Slack, it needs to be converted to Markdown and then to Slack Markdown.\n\n### Node 7: `Slack - Notify`\nThis node **sends a message in Slack containing the Pipedrive Organization Note** created with this workflow.\n",
