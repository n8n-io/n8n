# n8n - Workflow automation tool

n8n is an extendable workflow automation tool. With a [fair-code](http://faircode.io) distribution model, n8n will always have visible source code, be available to self-host, and allow you to add your own custom functions, logic and apps. n8n's node-based approach makes it highly versatile, enabling you to connect anything to everything.

## Demo

[:tv: A short video (< 4 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpjQTGKm-ok) that goes over key concepts of creating workflows in n8n.

## Available integrations

n8n has 200+ different nodes to automate workflows. The list can be found on: [https://n8n.io/nodes](https://n8n.io/nodes)

## Documentation

The official n8n documentation can be found under: [https://docs.n8n.io](https://docs.n8n.io)

Additional information and example workflows on the n8n.io website: [https://n8n.io](https://n8n.io)

## Start n8n in Docker

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

You can then access n8n by opening:
[http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678)

## Start with tunnel

> **WARNING**: This is only meant for local development and testing. Should not be used in production!

To be able to use webhooks which all triggers of external services like Github
rely on n8n has to be reachable from the web. To make that easy n8n has a
special tunnel service (uses this code: [https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel)) which redirects requests from our servers to your local
n8n instance.

To use it simply start n8n with `--tunnel`

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n \
 n8n start --tunnel
```

## Persist data

The workflow data gets by default saved in an SQLite database in the user
folder (`/home/node/.n8n`). That folder also additionally contains the
settings like webhook URL and encryption key.

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

### Start with other Database

By default n8n uses SQLite to save credentials, past executions and workflows.
n8n however also supports PostgresDB, MySQL and MariaDB. To use them simply a few
environment variables have to be set.

It is important to still persist the data in the `/root/.n8n` folder. The reason
is that it contains n8n user data. That is the name of the webhook
(in case) the n8n tunnel gets used and even more important the encryption key
for the credentials. If none gets found n8n creates automatically one on
startup. In case credentials are already saved with a different encryption key
it can not be used anymore as encrypting it is not possible anymore.

#### Use with PostgresDB

Replace the following placeholders with the actual data:

- POSTGRES_DATABASE
- POSTGRES_HOST
- POSTGRES_PASSWORD
- POSTGRES_PORT
- POSTGRES_USER
- POSTGRES_SCHEMA

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e DB_TYPE=postgresdb \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=<POSTGRES_DATABASE> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=<POSTGRES_HOST> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=<POSTGRES_PORT> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=<POSTGRES_USER> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA=<POSTGRES_SCHEMA> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=<POSTGRES_PASSWORD> \
 -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n \
 n8n start
```

A full working setup with docker-compose can be found [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/compose/withPostgres/README.md)

#### Use with MySQL

Replace the following placeholders with the actual data:

- MYSQLDB_DATABASE
- MYSQLDB_HOST
- MYSQLDB_PASSWORD
- MYSQLDB_PORT
- MYSQLDB_USER

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e DB_TYPE=mysqldb \
 -e DB_MYSQLDB_DATABASE=<MYSQLDB_DATABASE> \
 -e DB_MYSQLDB_HOST=<MYSQLDB_HOST> \
 -e DB_MYSQLDB_PORT=<MYSQLDB_PORT> \
 -e DB_MYSQLDB_USER=<MYSQLDB_USER> \
 -e DB_MYSQLDB_PASSWORD=<MYSQLDB_PASSWORD> \
 -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n \
 n8n start
```

## Passing Sensitive Data via File

To avoid passing sensitive information via environment variables "\_FILE" may be
appended to some environment variables. It will then load the data from a file
with the given name. That makes it possible to load data easily from
Docker- and Kubernetes-Secrets.

The following environment variables support file input:

- DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE_FILE
- DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST_FILE
- DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD_FILE
- DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT_FILE
- DB_POSTGRESDB_USER_FILE
- DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA_FILE

## Example Setup with Lets Encrypt

A basic step by step example setup of n8n with docker-compose and Lets Encrypt is available on the
[Server Setup](https://docs.n8n.io/#/server-setup) page.

## Updating a running docker-compose instance

1. Pull the latest version from the registry

   `docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n`

2. Stop the current setup

   `sudo docker-compose stop`

3. Delete it (will only delete the docker-containers, data is stored separately)

   `sudo docker-compose rm`

4. Then start it again

   `sudo docker-compose up -d`

## Setting Timezone

To define the timezone n8n should use, the environment variable `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` can
be set. This gets used by for example the Cron-Node.
Apart from that can also the timezone of the system be set separately. Which controls what
some scripts and commands return like `$ date`. The system timezone can be set via
the environment variable `TZ`.

Example to use the same timezone for both:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e GENERIC_TIMEZONE="Europe/Berlin" \
 -e TZ="Europe/Berlin" \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

## Build Docker-Image

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7 --build-arg N8N_VERSION=<VERSION> -t n8n:<VERSION> .

# For example:
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7 --build-arg N8N_VERSION=0.114.0 -t n8n:0.114.0 .
```

## What does n8n mean and how do you pronounce it?

**Short answer:** It means "nodemation" and it is pronounced as n-eight-n.

**Long answer:** I get that question quite often (more often than I expected)
so I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a
good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the
good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose
nodemation. "node-" in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses
Node.js and "-mation" for "automation" which is what the project is supposed to help with.
However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing
something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on
"n8n". Sure does not work perfectly but does neither for Kubernetes (k8s) and
did not hear anybody complain there. So I guess it should be ok.
