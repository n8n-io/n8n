Playwright Janitor - Static analysis for Playwright test architecture

Usage:
  playwright-janitor [command] [options]

Commands:
  (default)          Run static analysis rules
  rules              Show detailed information about all rules (for AI agents)
  baseline           Create/update baseline of known violations
  inventory          Show codebase inventory (pages, components, flows, tests)
  impact             Analyze impact of file changes (which tests to run)
  method-impact      Find tests that use a specific method (e.g., CanvasPage.addNode)
  tcr                Run TCR (Test && Commit || Revert) workflow

Analysis Options:
  --config=<path>    Path to janitor.config.js (default: ./janitor.config.js)
  --rule=<id>        Run a specific rule
  --file=<path>      Analyze a specific file
  --files=<p1,p2>    Analyze multiple files (comma-separated)
  --json             Output as JSON
  --verbose, -v      Detailed output with suggestions
  --fix              Preview fixes (dry run)
  --fix --write      Apply fixes to disk
  --list, -l         List available rules
  --allow-in-expect  Skip selector-purity violations inside expect()
  --ignore-baseline  Show all violations, ignoring .janitor-baseline.json
  --help, -h         Show this help

Examples:
  playwright-janitor                         # Run all rules
  playwright-janitor --rule=dead-code        # Run specific rule
  playwright-janitor inventory               # Show codebase structure
  playwright-janitor impact --file=pages/X   # Show what tests are affected
  playwright-janitor --fix --write           # Apply auto-fixes

For command-specific help:
  playwright-janitor rules --help
  playwright-janitor baseline --help
  playwright-janitor inventory --help
  playwright-janitor impact --help
  playwright-janitor method-impact --help
  playwright-janitor tcr --help

export function showInventoryHelp(): void {
	console.log(`
Inventory - Generate JSON inventory of codebase structure

Usage: playwright-janitor inventory

Outputs JSON containing: pages, components, composables, services,
fixtures, helpers, factories, and test data files.

Example: playwright-janitor inventory > inventory.json
`);
}

export function showImpactHelp(): void {
	console.log(`
Impact - Find affected tests for changed files

Options: --file=<path>, --files=<p1,p2>, --json, --test-list, --verbose
Example: playwright-janitor impact --test-list | xargs npx playwright test
`);
}

export function showMethodImpactHelp(): void {
	console.log(`
Method Impact - Find tests using a specific method

Options: --method=<Class.method>, --index, --json, --test-list, --verbose
Example: playwright-janitor method-impact --method=CanvasPage.addNode
`);
}

export function showTcrHelp(): void {
	console.log(`
TCR - Test && Commit || Revert workflow

Options:
  --execute, -x           Actually commit/revert (default: dry run)
  --message=<msg>         Commit message
  --target-branch=<name>  Branch to diff against
  --max-diff-lines=<n>    Skip if diff exceeds N lines
  --test-command=<cmd>    Test command (files appended)
  --json, --verbose

Example: playwright-janitor tcr --execute -m="Fix bug"
`);

export function showBaselineHelp(): void {
	console.log(`
Baseline - Snapshot current violations for incremental cleanup

Creates .janitor-baseline.json with all current violations. When this file
exists, janitor and TCR only fail on NEW violations not in the baseline.

Usage:
  playwright-janitor baseline              # Create/update baseline
  playwright-janitor baseline --verbose    # Show what's being baselined

Workflow:
  1. Run 'janitor baseline' to snapshot current state
  2. Commit .janitor-baseline.json
  3. Now TCR only fails on new violations
  4. As you fix violations, re-run 'janitor baseline' to update

Example:
  playwright-janitor baseline && git add .janitor-baseline.json
`);
}

export function showRulesHelp(): void {
	console.log(`
Rules - Show detailed information about available rules

Usage:
  playwright-janitor rules              # List all rules with descriptions
  playwright-janitor rules --json       # Output as JSON (for AI agents)
  playwright-janitor rules --verbose    # Include what each rule catches

Output includes:
  - Rule ID and name
  - Description
  - Severity (error/warning)
  - Whether it's fixable
  - What patterns it catches
  - Exceptions/allowed patterns

Example:
  playwright-janitor rules --json | jq '.[] | select(.id == "selector-purity")'
`);
}
