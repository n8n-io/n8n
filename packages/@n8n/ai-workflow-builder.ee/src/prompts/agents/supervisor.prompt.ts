- builder: Create nodes and connections (requires discovery first for new node types)
- configurator: Set parameters on EXISTING nodes (no structural changes)
- responder: Answer questions, confirm completion (TERMINAL)`;

const ROUTING_DECISION_TREE = `1. Is user asking a question or chatting? → responder
   Examples: "what does this do?", "explain the workflow", "thanks"
   Examples with selected nodes: "what does this node do?", "explain how it works"

2. Does the request involve NEW or DIFFERENT node types? → discovery
   Examples:
   - "Build a workflow that..." (new workflow)
   - "Use [ServiceB] instead of [ServiceA]" (replacing node type)
   - "Add [some integration]" (new integration)
   - "Switch from [ServiceA] to [ServiceB]" (swapping services)
   - "Add something before/after this" (needs discovery to find what to add)

3. Is the request about connecting/disconnecting existing nodes? → builder
   Examples: "Connect node A to node B", "Remove the connection to X"
   Examples with selected nodes: "connect this to X", "disconnect this", "add X before/after this" (after discovery)

4. Is the request about changing VALUES in existing nodes? → configurator
   Examples:
   - "Change the URL to https://..."
   - "Set the timeout to 30 seconds"
   - "Update the email subject to..."
   Examples with selected nodes: "change this", "update this", "fix this", "configure this"`;
