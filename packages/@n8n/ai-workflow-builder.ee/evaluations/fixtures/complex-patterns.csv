if-else-simple,"Create a workflow that checks if an API response status is 200. If true, send a success Slack message. If false, send an error notification.",if-else
if-else-chain,"Build a workflow that validates incoming data. If valid, format it, enrich it with additional details, and save to a database. If invalid, log the error.",if-else
if-else-merge,"Create a workflow that branches based on order status. If paid, process the payment. If unpaid, send a reminder. Both branches should merge and send a confirmation email.",if-merge
if-else-merge-complex,"Build a workflow that checks if a user is premium. Premium users get enhanced processing with API enrichment, standard users get basic processing. Both paths should merge to send a personalized response based on what processing was done.",if-merge
switch-3way,"Create a workflow that routes incoming webhooks based on event type: 'create' goes to a creation handler, 'update' goes to an update handler, and 'delete' goes to a deletion handler.",switch
switch-5way,"Build a workflow that routes support tickets based on priority. Urgent tickets escalate immediately, high priority notifies the manager, normal gets queued, low is archived for later, and unknown priorities go to a triage team.",switch
switch-with-chains,"Create a workflow that handles different payment types. Credit card payments need fraud check then processing. Bank transfers need validation then processing. Crypto needs conversion then processing. Cash payments just log directly.",switch
merge-2input,"Build a workflow that fetches data from two different APIs in parallel, merges the results, and then processes the combined data.",merge
merge-3input,"Create a workflow that gathers information from three sources in parallel: a weather API, a news API, and a stock API. Merge all results and generate a daily summary.",merge
merge-after-branch,"Build a workflow where the trigger fans out to three parallel processors: one for images, one for text, and one for metadata. All three merge back together for final assembly.",merge
split-batches-simple,"Create a workflow that fetches 1000 records from a database, processes them in batches of 50 (calling an external API for each), and then aggregates the results.",split-batches
split-batches-api,"Build a workflow that reads a list of email addresses, sends personalized emails in batches of 10 to avoid rate limits, and tracks which emails were sent successfully.",split-batches
nested-if-batch,"Create a workflow that checks if an order total exceeds $100. For high-value orders, split the items into batches of 5 for premium processing. For standard orders, process all items in bulk.",nested
nested-switch-merge,"Build a workflow that routes documents by type (invoice, receipt, contract). Each type has its own processing chain. All processed documents merge together for archival.",nested
nested-parallel-if,"Create a workflow that fetches data from 2 APIs in parallel. After merging, check if the combined data is complete. If yes, process and save. If no, send an alert.",nested

ai-agent-tools,"Create an AI workflow where the agent has access to a calculator tool and a web search tool to help answer user questions.",ai-agent
complex-order-pipeline,"Build an order processing workflow: receive webhook, validate order data (if invalid, reject), check inventory (use switch for in-stock, backorder, or out-of-stock paths), process payment, and send confirmation. All paths should eventually merge to update order status.",complex
complex-data-pipeline,"Create a data pipeline that: fetches data from 3 APIs in parallel, merges results, validates completeness, processes valid data in batches of 25, and generates a final report.",complex
