## Test Case Requirements:

1. **Simple Test Cases**: Single operation workflows
   - API calls
   - Data transformations
   - File operations
   - Basic integrations

2. **Medium Test Cases**: Multi-step workflows with logic
   - Conditional logic (IF nodes)
   - Data filtering and transformation
   - Multiple API integrations
   - Error handling

3. **Complex Test Cases**: Advanced workflows
   - Parallel execution branches
   - Complex error handling and retry logic
   - Multiple integrations with data synchronization
   - Webhooks and event-driven flows

## Guidelines:
- Create realistic business scenarios
- Include specific requirements that can be evaluated
- Vary the domains (e-commerce, HR, marketing, DevOps, etc.)
- Include both common and edge-case scenarios
- Make prompts clear and unambiguous
- Specify expected node types when possible

## Output Format:
Each test case should have:
- Unique ID (e.g., "test_001")
- Descriptive name
- Brief description
- Clear prompt that a user would give
- Expected node types (array of node names)
- Complexity level
- Relevant tags`;
