        systemMessage: '# General Instruction\nYou are a helpful AI agents that outputs n8n agents / workflows in JSON format.\n\n# Input\nYou receive the user request what the agent should be able to accomplish.\n\n# Output\nThe Output must be a valid n8n template JSON\n\n# Workflow\nThink carefully how the agent the user requests can be build. Start by conceptualizing the architecture. It might be helpful to reflect in how a human team would tackle the task or go backwards (starting with the desired end state). Note that most workflows need an AI agent as its "brain". Consult your tools whenever beneficial. Once you thought of a meaningful structure actually populate the template with the nodes. Work very iterative and use the tools EXTENSIVELY! Fill the nodes with the correct content and CONNECT them properly! In a last check everything and make sure all nodes are properly connected! All but the trigger and final Output node must be connected to at least one input and one output node. Whenever you need information regarding what is possible in n8n, with what nodes and how they are set up and connected, consult the tools as you see it fit. \n\n# Tools\nYou have access to the following tools:\n1) Pinecone vector store containing some of n8n decumentation, saved in a Pinecone Vector database\n2) SerpAPI web search tool, with which you can search for example existing n8n workflows and templates or node characteristics (leverage this a lot!)\n\n# User node preferences (if not specified differently by the user use the following nodes for the listed functionalities):\nvector database: {{ $json[\'vector database\'] }}\nchat model: {{ $json[\'chat model\'] }}\nembeddings: {{ $json.embedding }}\nweb search tool: {{ $json[\'web search tool\'] }}\n\n# Examples (variables are replaced with "...")\n--> output refers to the final result. still do not skip an elaborate step by step thinking process and extensive tool use!\n## example 1\n### input: automation flow is designed to automatically monitor incoming Gmail messages, analyze their content and context using AI, and intelligently classify them with appropriate labels for better email organization and prioritization\n\n### output: {\n  "id": "uf6t5qhnQMgilteE",\n  "meta": {\n    "instanceId": "f694ebfb8236012bcdeb0adbc4faa465b6fa315f9ad30732114d26f7419da901",\n    "templateCredsSetupCompleted": true\n  },\n  "name": "Email Manager",\n  "tags": [\n    {\n      "id": "xG398zgKum2bPs6D",\n      "name": "Personal Assistant",\n      "createdAt": "2025-05-28T13:58:43.876Z",\n      "updatedAt": "2025-05-28T13:58:43.876Z"\n    }\n  ],\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "id": "5e01a927-caf7-41ad-aca7-d7504e313564",\n      "name": "Gmail Trigger",\n      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.gmailTrigger",\n      "position": [\n        -20,\n        -60\n      ],\n      "parameters": {\n        "filters": {},\n        "pollTimes": {\n          "item": [\n            {\n              "mode": "everyMinute"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      },\n      "credentials": {\n        "gmailOAuth2": {\n          "id": "Ldq2rjN6Dod5DoKl",\n          "name": "Gmail account"\n        }\n      },\n      "typeVersion": 1.2\n    },\n    {\n      "id": "a8644856-a8bf-49de-84a7-3fd9f93550d3",\n      "name": "Gmail",\n      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.gmail",\n      "position": [\n        200,\n        -20\n      ],\n      "webhookId": "01c91a6b-4d45-4630-8e81-0f82ee5d6524",\n      "parameters": {\n        "simple": false,\n        "options": {},\n        "messageId": "=...",\n        "operation": "get"\n      },\n      "credentials": {\n        "gmailOAuth2": {\n          "id": "Ldq2rjN6Dod5DoKl",\n          "name": "Gmail account"\n        }\n      },\n      "typeVersion": 2.1\n    },\n    {\n      "id": "f6ddae9f-303b-46cd-980d-1d46fc4ecbec",\n      "name": "Structured Output Parser",\n      "type": "@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputParserStructured",\n      "position": [\n        1000,\n        100\n      ],\n      "parameters": {\n        "jsonSchemaExample": "{\\n\\t\\"label\\": \\"Label name\\", \\n\\"label ID\\": \\"label ID\\" \\n}"\n      },\n      "typeVersion": 1.2\n    },\n    {\n      "id": "cc6b0990-a778-4199-a0fe-80c83dfb9934",\n      "name": "Gmail1",\n      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.gmail",\n      "position": [\n        1020,\n        -220\n      ],\n      "webhookId": "575a4038-3b07-46b9-be69-39cfc1d47d7e",\n      "parameters": {\n        "labelIds": "= ...

They should be super valuable to my audience.\\n\\nSCENARIO: I run a LinkedIn blog about marketing and sales. My audience is marketers, salespeople, founders, B2B business owners, B2C business owners, brands. My goal is to help them build better brands with valuable, and practical content. \\nI have 4 main buckets of content on my page:\\n1) timeless principles. ideas for this videos are taken from timeless books: Influnece and Pre-Suasion by Robert Cialdini, $100M Leads and $100M Offers by Alex Hormozi, Ogilvy on Advertising.\\n2) case studies. for instance a case study breaking down on of the famous ads from the latest SuperBowl.\\n3) growth hacks. latest trends on how to grow with a proof. for instance an SEO tactic that became known in the last year.\\n4) contraversial ads. breakdowns of interesting and famous contraversial ads.\\nEvery video that I post is focused solely on one of the content buckets. That makes my content more diverse and covering more cool topics.\\n\\nEXPECTATION: Write me 1) name (short name for the post, less than 50 characters), 2) idea (detailed description in 3 sentences max), 3) title (the first sentence of the post, less than 80 characters, it should be ultra hooking), 4) full text of the post, 5) image description (the image is the first thing people will look at, so make it ultra hooking; write the image description to be super clear and ultra simple, so the AI image generator will precisely know that to generate; the image should be minimalistic) for a 200-300 words LinkedIn post from one of the content buckets described above.\\nMake sure to have great: hook, retention, and reward at the end.\\nThe post should clearly lead to a marketing/sales insight.\\nYour output should be in the JSON format.\\nIdea should always start with a category: Timeless principle, Case study, Growth hack, Contraversial ad.\\nExample output:\\n{\\"name\\": \\"The Power of Social Proof\\",\\n\\"idea\\": \\"Timeless principle: Social proof is a psychological phenomenon that influences decision-making by showing how others\' actions affect our own choices.
