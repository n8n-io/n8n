# Node configuration safety

Rules for configuring nodes from type definitions and live resource exploration.
Read when node parameters are unclear or a service-specific quirk is suspected.

- Fetch `nodes(action="type-definition")` before configuring nodes. Generated
  definitions and `@builderHint` annotations are the source of truth.
- Use live `nodes(action="explore-resources")` for resource locator, list, and
  model fields when credentials are available.
- If a configuration is unclear after reading the definition, ask for
  clarification or use placeholders. Do not guess.
- Pay attention to `@builderHint` annotations in search results and type
  definitions. They contain node-specific configuration rules and examples.
- Gmail archive: the message resource has no `archive` operation. To archive a
  Gmail message, remove the `INBOX` label with `operation: 'removeLabels'` and
  `labelIds: ['INBOX']`; do not add an invented `ARCHIVE` label.
