# Workflow builder credential rules

Rules for `newCredential()` and credential discovery in SDK builder code. Read
when the workflow touches external services.

- Call `credentials(action="list")` early when the task touches external
  services. Note each credential's `id`, `name`, and `type`.
- Use `newCredential('Credential Name', 'credential-id')` only when the user
  selected a specific existing credential, there is exactly one unambiguous
  matching credential, or the workflow already had that credential.
- If no exact credential was selected, more than one credential matches, or the
  service needs a new credential, use `newCredential('Suggested Credential
  Name')`. Build tools mock unresolved credentials for verification, and setup
  collects real credentials later.
- Never use raw credential objects like `{ id: '...', name: '...' }` in builder
  SDK code. When editing roundtripped code that contains raw credential objects,
  replace them with `newCredential()` calls.
- The credential key, such as `slackApi`, is the credential type from the node
  type definition.
- If a required credential type is not listed, call
  `credentials(action="search-types")` with the service name. Prefer dedicated
  credential types over generic auth. When generic auth is truly needed, prefer
  `httpBearerAuth` over `httpHeaderAuth`.
- Credential-selection guidance applies to outbound service calls. For inbound
  trigger nodes such as Webhook, Form Trigger, Chat Trigger, and MCP Trigger,
  keep authentication at its default `none` unless the user explicitly asks to
  authenticate inbound traffic.
- Always declare `output` on nodes that use unresolved credentials when mock data
  is needed for verification.
