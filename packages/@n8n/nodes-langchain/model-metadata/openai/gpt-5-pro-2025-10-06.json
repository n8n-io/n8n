	"description": "GPT-5 Pro is OpenAI's most advanced model optimized for complex tasks requiring step-by-step reasoning, instruction following, and accuracy in high-stakes use cases. Released in October 2025, it offers major improvements in reasoning quality, code generation, and test-time routing capabilities.",
	"trainingCutoff": "2024-09",
	"notes": "Most capable model for critical workloads requiring maximum accuracy. Supports test-time routing features and advanced prompt understanding, including user-specified reasoning depth. Significantly slower than GPT-5 due to extended reasoning process. Can process up to 400K context window. This is the timestamped version from October 6, 2025."
