	"description": "Specialized speech-to-text model trained with reinforcement learning for state-of-the-art transcription accuracy. Achieves improved Word Error Rate (WER) over Whisper V3, with better handling of accented speech, diverse dialects, and challenging audio environments.",
	"trainingCutoff": "2024-10",
	"notes": "Released March 2025. Supports 100+ languages and dialects. Fast transcription: converts 10 minutes of audio in ~15 seconds. File uploads limited to 25MB. Trained on diverse, high-quality audio datasets with RL-heavy paradigm for improved accuracy. Does not support speaker diarization - use gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize for that. Approximately $0.006 per minute of audio."
