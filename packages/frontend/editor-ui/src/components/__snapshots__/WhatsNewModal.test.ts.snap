      <p>
        Large, monolithic workflows can slow things down. They’re harder to maintain, tougher to debug, and more difficult to scale. With sub-workflows, you can take a more modular approach, breaking up big workflows into smaller, manageable parts that are easier to reuse, test, understand, and explain.
      </p>
      

      <p>
        Until now, creating sub-workflows required copying and pasting nodes manually, setting up a new workflow from scratch, and reconnecting everything by hand. 
        <strong>
          Convert to sub-workflow
        </strong>
         allows you to simplify this process into a single action, so you can spend more time building and less time restructuring.
      </p>
      

      <h3>
        How it works
      </h3>
      

      <ol>
        

        <li>
          Highlight the nodes you want to convert to a sub-workflow. These must:

          <ul>
            

            <li>
              Be fully connected, meaning no missing steps in between them
            </li>
            

            <li>
              Start from a single starting node
            </li>
            

            <li>
              End with a single node
            </li>
            

          </ul>
          

        </li>
        

        <li>
          Right-click to open the context menu and select 
          <strong>
            Convert to sub-workflow
          </strong>
          

          <ul>
            

            <li>
              Or use the shortcut: 
              <code>
                Alt + X
              </code>
            </li>
            

          </ul>
          

        </li>
        

        <li>
          n8n will:

          <ul>
            

            <li>
              Open a new tab containing the selected nodes
            </li>
            

            <li>
              Preserve all node parameters as-is
            </li>
            

            <li>
              Replace the selected nodes in the original workflow with a 
              <strong>
                Call My Sub-workflow
              </strong>
               node
            </li>
            

          </ul>
          

        </li>
        

      </ol>
      

      <p>
        <em>
          Note:
        </em>
         You will need to manually adjust the field types in the Start and Return nodes in the new sub-workflow.
      </p>
      

      <p>
        This makes it easier to keep workflows modular, performant, and easier to maintain.
