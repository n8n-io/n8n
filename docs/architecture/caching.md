# Caching Architecture

> **⚠️ Notice**: This document was created by AI and not properly reviewed by the team yet.

## Overview

n8n implements multiple caching layers to improve performance and reduce database load. The caching system is particularly important in scaled deployments.

## TODO: Document the Following

### Caching Layers
- In-memory caching (single instance)
- Redis caching (distributed)
- Database query caching
- Static data caching

### Cached Data Types
- Node type definitions
- Workflow static data
- User sessions
- Credentials metadata
- License information

### Architecture
- Cache key strategies
- TTL management
- Cache invalidation patterns
- Cache warming strategies

### Redis Integration
- Redis as distributed cache
- Cache sharing between instances
- Pub/Sub for cache invalidation
- Connection pooling

### Implementation Details
- Cache service implementations
- Integration with repositories
- Cache decorators
- Performance monitoring

### Cache Strategies
- Read-through caching
- Write-through caching
- Cache-aside pattern
- Lazy loading

### Configuration
- Cache TTL settings
- Redis connection settings
- Memory limits
- Cache enable/disable flags

### Monitoring
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Memory usage
- Performance metrics
- Debug logging
