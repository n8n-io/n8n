     * - clientID: the application ID of your application. You can obtain one by registering your application with our application registration portal
     * - authority: the authority URL for your application.
     * - client credential: Must set either client secret, certificate, or assertion for confidential clients. You can obtain a client secret from the application registration portal.
     *
     * In Azure AD, authority is a URL indicating of the form https://login.microsoftonline.com/\{Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here\}.
     * If your application supports Accounts in one organizational directory, replace "Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here" value with the Tenant Id or Tenant name (for example, contoso.microsoft.com).
     * If your application supports Accounts in any organizational directory, replace "Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here" value with organizations.
     * If your application supports Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts, replace "Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here" value with common.
     * To restrict support to Personal Microsoft accounts only, replace "Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here" value with consumers.
     *
     * In Azure B2C, authority is of the form https://\{instance\}/tfp/\{tenant\}/\{policyName\}/
     * Full B2C functionality will be available in this library in future versions.
