# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in the n8n repository.

## Project Overview

n8n is a workflow automation platform written in TypeScript, using a monorepo
structure managed by pnpm workspaces. It consists of a Node.js backend, Vue.js
frontend, and extensible node-based workflow engine.

## General Guidelines

- Always use pnpm
- We use Linear as a ticket tracking system
- We use Posthog for feature flags
- When starting to work on a new ticket – create a new branch from fresh
  master with the name specified in Linear ticket
- When creating a new branch for a ticket in Linear - use the branch name
  suggested by linear
- Use mermaid diagrams in MD files when you need to visualise something

## Essential Commands

### Building
Use `pnpm build` to build all packages. ALWAYS redirect the output of the
build command to a file:

```bash
pnpm build > build.log 2>&1
```

You can inspect the last few lines of the build log file to check for errors:
```bash
tail -n 20 build.log
```

### Testing
- `pnpm test` - Run all tests
- `pnpm test:affected` - Runs tests based on what has changed since the last
  commit
- `pnpm dev:e2e` - E2E tests in development mode

Running a particular test file requires going to the directory of that test
and running: `pnpm test <test-file>`.

When changing directories, use `pushd` to navigate into the directory and
`popd` to return to the previous directory. When in doubt, use `pwd` to check
your current directory.

### Code Quality
- `pnpm lint` - Lint code
- `pnpm typecheck` - Run type checks

Always run lint and typecheck before committing code to ensure quality.
Execute these commands from within the specific package directory you're
working on (e.g., `cd packages/cli && pnpm lint`). Run the full repository
check only when preparing the final PR. When your changes affect type
definitions, interfaces in `@n8n/api-types`, or cross-package dependencies,
build the system before running lint and typecheck.

## Architecture Overview

**Monorepo Structure:** pnpm workspaces with Turbo build orchestration

### Package Structure

The monorepo is organized into these key packages:

- **`packages/@n8n/api-types`**: Shared TypeScript interfaces between frontend and backend
- **`packages/workflow`**: Core workflow interfaces and types
- **`packages/core`**: Workflow execution engine
- **`packages/cli`**: Express server, REST API, and CLI commands
- **`packages/editor-ui`**: Vue 3 frontend application
- **`packages/@n8n/i18n`**: Internationalization for UI text
- **`packages/nodes-base`**: Built-in nodes for integrations
- **`packages/@n8n/nodes-langchain`**: AI/LangChain nodes
- **`@n8n/design-system`**: Vue component library for UI consistency
- **`@n8n/config`**: Centralized configuration management

### Using architecture docs

The `docs/architecture` directory contains system architecture documentation covering design decisions and implementation details.
These documents are essential for understanding how different components of the system interact and are structured.
You can search for specific features or subsystems in these documents, or start with `docs/architecture/README.md` for navigation.

When working on features:
1. Check relevant architecture docs before making changes
2. Search docs for existing patterns and conventions

When user asks questions – always search for the relevant docs before answering.

Note: Documentation is work in progress - some areas may be incomplete.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + Pinia + Storybook UI Library
- **Backend:** Node.js + TypeScript + Express + TypeORM
- **Testing:** Jest (unit) + Playwright (E2E)
- **Database:** TypeORM with SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL support
- **Code Quality:** Biome (for formatting) + ESLint + lefthook git hooks

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Dependency Injection**: Uses `@n8n/di` for IoC container
2. **Controller-Service-Repository**: Backend follows MVC-like pattern
3. **Event-Driven**: Internal event bus for decoupled communication
4. **Context-Based Execution**: Different contexts for different node types
5. **State Management**: Frontend uses Pinia stores
6. **Design System**: Reusable components and design tokens are centralized in
   `@n8n/design-system`, where all pure Vue components should be placed to
   ensure consistency and reusability

## Key Development Patterns

- Each package has isolated build configuration and can be developed independently
- Hot reload works across the full stack during development
- Node development uses dedicated `node-dev` CLI tool
- Workflow tests are JSON-based for integration testing
- AI features have dedicated development workflow (`pnpm dev:ai`)

### TypeScript Best Practices
- **NEVER use `any` type** - use proper types or `unknown`
- **Avoid type casting with `as`** - use type guards or type predicates instead
- **Define shared interfaces in `@n8n/api-types`** package for FE/BE communication

### Error Handling
- Don't use `ApplicationError` class in CLI and nodes for throwing errors,
  because it's deprecated. Use `UnexpectedError`, `OperationalError` or
  `UserError` instead.
- Import from appropriate error classes in each package

### Frontend Development
- **All UI text must use i18n** - add translations to `@n8n/i18n` package
- **Use CSS variables directly** - never hardcode spacing as px values
- **data-test-id must be a single value** (no spaces or multiple values)

When implementing CSS, refer to @packages/frontend/CLAUDE.md for guidelines on
CSS variables and styling conventions.

### Testing Guidelines
- **Always work from within the package directory** when running tests
- **Mock all external dependencies** in unit tests
- **Confirm test cases with user** before writing unit tests
- **Typecheck is critical before committing** - always run `pnpm typecheck`
- **When modifying pinia stores**, check for unused computed properties

What we use for testing and writing tests:
- For testing nodes and other backend components, we use Jest for unit tests. Examples can be found in `packages/nodes-base/nodes/**/*test*`.
- We use `nock` for server mocking
- For frontend we use `vitest`
- For e2e tests we use `Playwright` and `pnpm dev:e2e`. The old Cypress tests
  are being migrated to Playwright, so please use Playwright for new tests.

### Common Development Tasks

When implementing features:
1. Define API types in `packages/@n8n/api-types`
2. Implement backend logic in `packages/cli` module, follow
   `@packages/cli/scripts/backend-module/backend-module.guide.md`
3. Add API endpoints via controllers
4. Update frontend in `packages/editor-ui` with i18n support
5. Write tests with proper mocks
6. Run `pnpm typecheck` to verify types

## Github Guidelines
- When creating a PR, use the conventions in
  `.github/pull_request_template.md` and
  `.github/pull_request_title_conventions.md`.
- Use `gh pr create --draft` to create draft PRs.
- Always reference the Linear ticket in the PR description,
  use `https://linear.app/n8n/issue/[TICKET-ID]`
- always link to the github issue if mentioned in the linear ticket.
