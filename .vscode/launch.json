	/**
		How this works:

		This file gives VS Code the ability to start and debug n8n.
		The editor is not debuggable from here.

		The "Run and Debug" tab of your editor should display the "Launch n8n with debug" option.
		This should start n8n and open a debug console. You can add breakpoints to
		Parts of the code residing inside `cli`, `core`, `workflow` and `nodes-base` packages

		You can also choose to "Attach to running n8n". This is useful if you
		have n8n running in another terminal window and want to debug it.
		Once you click to Debug, VS Code will prompt you to select a process to attach to.
