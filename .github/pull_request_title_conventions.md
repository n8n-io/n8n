# PR Title Convention

We have very precise rules over how Pull Requests (to the `master` branch) must be formatted. This format basically follows the [Angular Commit Message Convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit). It leads to easier to read commit history and allows for automated generation of release notes:

A PR title consists of these elements:

```
<type>(<scope>): <summary>
  │       │          │
  │       │          └─⫸ Summary: In imperative present tense.
  |       |                        Capitalized
  |       |                        No period at the end.
  │       │
  │       └─⫸ Scope: API|core|editor|* Node
  │
  └─⫸ Type: build|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|test
```

- PR title
    - type
    - scope (*optional*)
    - summary
- PR description
    - body (optional)
    - blank line
    - footer (optional)

The structure looks like this:

### **Type**

Must be one of the following:

- `feat` - A new feature
- `fix` - A bug fix
- `perf` - A code change that improves performance
- `test` - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `docs` - Documentation only changes
- `refactor` - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `build` - Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: broccoli, npm)
- `ci` - Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (e.g. Github actions)

If the prefix is `feat`, `fix` or `perf`, it will appear in the changelog. However if there is any BREAKING CHANGE (see Footer section below), the commit will always appear in the changelog.

### **Scope (optional)**

The scope should specify the place of the commit change as long as the commit clearly addresses one of the following supported scopes. (Otherwise, omit the scope!)

- `API` - changes to the *public* API
- `core` - changes to the core / private API / backend of n8n
- `editor` - changes to the Editor UI
- `* Node` - changes to a specific node or trigger node (”`*`” to be replaced with the node name, not its display name), e.g.
    - mattermost → Mattermost Node
    - microsoftToDo  → Microsoft To Do Node
    - n8n → n8n Node

### **Summary**

The summary contains succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- capitalize the first letter
- *no* dot (.) at the end
- do *not* include Linear ticket IDs etc. (e.g. N8N-1234)
- suffix with “(no-changelog)” for commits / PRs that should not get mentioned in the changelog.

### **Body (optional)**

Just as in the **summary**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### **Footer (optional)**

The footer can contain information about breaking changes and deprecations and is also the place to [reference GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword), Linear tickets, and other PRs that this commit closes or is related to. For example:

```
BREAKING CHANGE: <breaking change summary>
<BLANK LINE>
<breaking change description + migration instructions>
<BLANK LINE>
<BLANK LINE>
Fixes #<issue number>
```

or

```
DEPRECATED: <what is deprecated>
<BLANK LINE>
<deprecation description + recommended update path>
<BLANK LINE>
<BLANK LINE>
Closes #<pr number>
```

A Breaking Change section should start with the phrase "`BREAKING CHANGE:` " followed by a summary of the breaking change, a blank line, and a detailed description of the breaking change that also includes migration instructions.

> 💡 A breaking change can additionally also be marked by adding a “`!`” to the header, right before the “`:`”, e.g. `feat(editor)!: Remove support for dark mode`
> 
> This makes locating breaking changes easier when just skimming through commit messages.

> 💡 The breaking changes must also be added to the [packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md) file located in the n8n repository.

Similarly, a Deprecation section should start with "`DEPRECATED:` " followed by a short description of what is deprecated, a blank line, and a detailed description of the deprecation that also mentions the recommended update path.

### **Revert commits**

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:` , followed by the header of the reverted commit.

The content of the commit message body should contain:

- information about the SHA of the commit being reverted in the following format: `This reverts commit <SHA>`,
- a clear description of the reason for reverting the commit message.
