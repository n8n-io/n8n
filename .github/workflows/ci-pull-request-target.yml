name: 'CI: Pull Request Target (Fork PRs)'

# This workflow handles CI for fork/community PRs.
# It uses pull_request_target to run in the base repo context (access to secrets).
# Security: GitHub's "Require approval for all outside collaborators" setting
# ensures maintainer approval before this runs on fork PRs.
