Nodes environment variables
#
File-based configuration
You can add
_FILE
to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to
Keeping sensitive data in separate files
for more details.
This page lists the environment variables configuration options for managing
nodes
in n8n, including specifying which nodes to load or exclude, importing built-in or external modules in the Code node, and enabling community nodes.

Default
Description
NODES_INCLUDE
Array of strings
-
Specify which nodes to load.

Array of strings

NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN
String
-
Permit users to import specific built-in modules in the Code node. Use * to allow all. n8n disables importing modules by default.
NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL

) in the Code node. n8n disables importing modules by default.

N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_REGISTRY
String
https://registry.npmjs.org
NPM registry URL to pull community packages from (license required).
N8N_VERIFIED_PACKAGES_ENABLED
Boolean
true
When
N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED
is true, this variable controls whether to show verified community nodes in the nodes panel for installation and use (true) or to hide them (false).
N8N_UNVERIFIED_PACKAGES_ENABLED
Boolean
true
When
N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED
is true, this variable controls whether to enable the installation and use of unverified community nodes from an NPM registry (true) or not (false).
N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_PREVENT_LOADING
Boolean
false
Prevents (true) or allows (false) loading installed community nodes on instance startup. Use this if a faulty node prevents the instance from starting.
