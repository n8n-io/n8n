n8n v1.0 migration guide
#
This document provides a summary of what you should be aware of before updating to version 1.0 of n8n.
The release of n8n 1.0 marks a milestone in n8n's journey to make n8n available for demanding production environments. Version 1.0 represents the hard work invested over the last four years to make n8n the most accessible, powerful, and versatile automation tool. n8n 1.0 is now ready for use in production.
New features
#
Python support in the Code node
#
Although JavaScript remains the default language, you can now also select Python as an option in the
Code node
and even make use of
many Python modules
. Note that Python is unavailable in Code nodes added to a workflow before v1.0.

Execution order
#
n8n 1.0 introduces a new execution order for multi-branch workflows:
In multi-branch workflows, n8n needs to determine the order in which to execute nodes on branches. Previously, n8n executed the first node of each branch, then the second of each branch, and so on (breadth-first). The new execution order ensures that each branch executes completely before starting the next one (depth-first). Branches execute based on their position on the canvas, from top to bottom. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost one executes first.
n8n used to execute multi-input nodes as long as they received data on their first input. Nodes connected to the second input of multi-input nodes automatically executed regardless of whether they received data. The new execution order introduced in n8n 1.0 simplifies this behavior: Nodes are now executed only when they receive data, and multi-input nodes require data on at least one of their inputs to execute.
Your existing workflows will use the legacy order, while new workflows will execute using the v1 order. You can configure the execution order for each workflow in
workflow settings

Deprecations
#
MySQL and MariaDB
#
n8n has removed support for MySQL and MariaDB as storage backends for n8n. These database systems are used by only a few users, yet they require continuous development and maintenance efforts. n8n recommends migrating to PostgreSQL for better compatibility and long-term support.
PR #6189
EXECUTIONS_PROCESS and "own" mode
#
Previously, you could use the
EXECUTIONS_PROCESS
environment variable to specify whether executions should run in the
main
process or in their
own
processes. This option and
own
mode are now deprecated and will be removed in a future version of n8n. This is because it led to increased code complexity while offering marginal benefits. Starting from n8n 1.0,
main
will be the new default.
Note that executions start much faster in
main
mode than in
own
mode. However, if a workflow consumes more memory than is available, it might crash the entire n8n application instead of just the worker thread. To mitigate this, make sure to allocate enough system resources or configure
queue mode
to distribute executions among multiple workers.

Breaking changes
#
Docker
#
Permissions change
#
When using Docker-based deployments, the n8n process is now run by the user
node
instead of
root
. This change increases security.
If permission errors appear in your n8n container logs when starting n8n, you may need to update the permissions by executing the following command on the Docker host:
1
docker
run
--rm
-it
--user
root
-v
~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n
--entrypoint
chown
n8nio/base:16
-R
node:node
/home/node/.n8n
Image removal
#
We've removed the Debian and RHEL images. If you were using these you need to change the image you use. This shouldn't result in any errors unless you were making a custom image based on one of those images.
Entrypoint change
#
The entrypoint for the container has changed and you no longer need to specify the n8n command. If you were previously running
n8n worker --concurrency=5
it's now
worker --concurrency=5
PR #6365
Workflow failures due to expression errors
#
Workflow executions may fail due to syntax or runtime errors in expressions, such as those that reference non-existent nodes. While expressions already throw errors on the frontend, this change ensures that n8n also throws errors on the backend, where they were previously silently ignored. To receive notifications of failing workflows, n8n recommends setting up an "error workflow" under workflow settings.
PR #6352
Mandatory owner account
#
This change makes
User Management
mandatory and removes support for other authentication methods, such as BasicAuth and External JWT. Note that the number of permitted users on
n8n.cloud
or custom plans still varies depending on your subscription.
PR #6362
Directory for installing custom nodes
#
n8n will no longer load custom nodes from its global
node_modules
directory. Instead, you must install (or link) them to
~/.n8n/custom
(or a directory defined by
N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS
). Custom nodes that are npm packages will be located in
~/.n8n/nodes
.
If you have custom nodes that were linked using
npm link
into the global
node_modules
directory, you need to link them again, into
~/.n8n/nodes
instead.
PR #6396
WebSockets
#
The
N8N_PUSH_BACKEND
environment variable can be used to configure one of two available methods for pushing updates to the user interface:
sse
and
websocket
. Starting with n8n 1.0,
websocket
is the default method.
PR #6196
Date transformation functions
#
n8n provides various transformation functions that operate on dates. These functions may return either a JavaScript
Date
or a Luxon
DateTime
object. With the new behavior, the return type always matches the input. If you call a date transformation function on a
Date
, it returns a
Date
. Similarly, if you call it on a
DateTime
object, it returns a
DateTime
object.
To identify any workflows and nodes that might be impacted by this change, you can use this
utility workflow
.
For more information about date transformation functions, please refer to the
official documentation
.
PR #6435
Execution data retention
#
Starting from n8n 1.0, all successful, failed, and manual workflow executions will be saved by default. These settings can be modified for each workflow under "Workflow Settings," or globally using the respective environment variables. Additionally, the
EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE
setting will be enabled by default, with
EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT
set to 10,000. These default settings are designed to prevent performance degradation when using SQLite. Make sure to configure them according to your individual requirements and system capacity.
PR #6577
Removed N8N_USE_DEPRECATED_REQUEST_LIB
#
The legacy
request
library has been deprecated for some time now. As of n8n 1.0, the ability to fall back to it in the HTTP Request node by setting the
N8N_USE_DEPRECATED_REQUEST_LIB
environment variable has been fully removed. The HTTP Request node will now always use the new
HttpRequest
interface.
If you build custom nodes, refer to
HTTP request helpers
for more information on migrating to the new interface.
PR #6413
Removed WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL
#
As of version 0.227.0, n8n has renamed the
WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL
configuration option to
WEBHOOK_URL
. In n8n 1.0,
WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL
has been removed. Update your setup to reflect the new name. For more information about this configuration option, refer to
the docs

PR #1408
Remove Node 16 support
#
n8n now requires Node 18.17.0 or above.
Updating to n8n 1.0
#
Create a full backup of n8n.
n8n recommends updating to the latest n8n 0.x release before updating to n8n 1.x. This will allow you to pinpoint any potential issues to the correct release. Once you have verified that n8n 0.x starts up without any issues, proceed to the next step.
Carefully read the
Deprecations
and
Breaking Changes
sections above to assess how they may affect your setup.
Update to n8n 1.0:
During beta (before July 24th 2023): If using Docker, pull the
next
Docker image.
After July 24th 2023: If using Docker, pull the
latest
Docker image.
If you encounter any issues, redeploy the previous n8n version and restore the backup.
