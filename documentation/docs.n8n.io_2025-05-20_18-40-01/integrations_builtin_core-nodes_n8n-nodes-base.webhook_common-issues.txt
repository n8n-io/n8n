Common issues and questions
#
Here are some common issues and questions for the
Webhook node
and suggested solutions.
Listen for multiple HTTP methods
#
By default, the Webhook node accepts calls that use a single method. For example, it can accept GET or POST requests, but not both. If you want to accept calls using multiple methods:
Open the node
Settings
.
Turn on
Allow Multiple HTTP Methods
.
Return to
Parameters
. By default, the node now accepts GET and POST calls. You can add other methods in the
HTTP Methods
field.
The Webhook node has an output for each method, so you can perform different actions depending on the method.
Use the HTTP Request node to trigger the Webhook node
#
The
HTTP Request
node makes HTTP requests to the URL you specify.
Create a new workflow.
Add the HTTP Request node to the workflow.
Select a method from the
Request Method
dropdown list. For example, if you select GET as the
HTTP method
in your Webhook node, select GET as the request method in the HTTP Request node.
Copy the URL from the Webhook node, and paste it in the
URL
field in the HTTP Request node.
If using the test URL for the webhook node: execute the workflow with the Webhook node.
Execute the HTTP Request node.
Use curl to trigger the Webhook node
#
You can use
curl
to make HTTP requests that trigger the Webhook node.
Note
In the examples, replace
<https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>
with your webhook URL.
The examples make GET requests. You can use whichever HTTP method you set in
HTTP Method
.
Make an HTTP request without any parameters:
1
curl
--request
GET
<https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>
Make an HTTP request with a body parameter:
1
curl
--request
GET
<https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>
--data
'key=value'
Make an HTTP request with header parameter:
1
curl
--request
GET
<https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>
--header
'key=value'
Make an HTTP request to send a file:
1
curl
--request
GET
<https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>
--from
'key=@/path/to/file'
Replace
/path/to/file
with the path of the file you want to send.
Send a response of type string
#
By default, the response format is JSON or an array. To send a response of type string:
Select
Response Mode
>
When Last Node Finishes
.
Select
Response Data
>
First Entry JSON
.
Select
Add Option
>
Property Name
.
Enter the name of the property that contains the response. This defaults to
data
.
Connect an
Edit Fields node
to the Webhook node.
In the Edit Fields node, select
Add Value
>
String
.
Enter the name of the property in the
Name
field. The name should match the property name from step 4.
Enter the string value in the
Value
field.
Toggle
Keep Only Set
to on (green).
When you call the Webhook, it sends the string response from the Edit Fields node.
Test URL versus Production URL
#
n8n generates two
Webhook URLs
for each Webhook node: a
Test URL
and a
Production URL
.
While building or testing a workflow, use the
Test URL
. Once you're ready to use your Webhook URL in production, use the
Production URL
.
URL type
How to trigger
Listening duration
Data shown in editor UI?
Test URL
Select
Listen for test event
and trigger a test event from the source.
120 seconds
Production URL
Activate the workflow
Until workflow deactivated
Refer to
Workflow development
for more information.
IPs in Whitelist are failing to connect
#
If you're unable to connect from IPs in your IP Whitelist, check if you are running n8n behind a reverse proxy.
If so, set the
N8N_PROXY_HOPS
environment variable
to the number of reverse-proxies n8n is running behind.
