n8n Form node
#
Use the n8n Form node to create user-facing forms with multiple steps. You can add other nodes with custom logic between to process user input. You must start the workflow with the
n8n Form Trigger
.

Setting up the node
#
Set default selections with query parameters
#
You can set the initial values for fields by using
query parameters
with the initial URL provided by the
n8n Form Trigger
. Every page in the form receives the same query parameters sent to the n8n Form Trigger URL.
Only for production
Query parameters are only available when using the form in production mode. n8n won't populate field values from query parameters in testing mode.
When using query parameters,
percent-encode
any field names or values that use special characters. This ensures n8n uses the initial values for the given fields. You can use tools like
URL Encode/Decode
to format your query parameters using percent-encoding.
As an example, imagine you have a form with the following properties:
Production URL:
https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form
Fields:
name
:
Jane Doe
email
:
jane.doe@example.com
With query parameters and percent-encoding, you could use the following URL to set initial field values to the data above:
1
https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form?email=jane.doe%40example.com&name=Jane%20Doe
Here, percent-encoding replaces the at-symbol (
@
) with the string
%40
and the space character (
) with the string
%20
. This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on.
Displaying custom HTML
#
You can display custom HTML on your form by adding a
Custom HTML
field to your form. This provides an
HTML
box where you can insert arbitrary HTML code to display as part of the form page.
You can use the HTML field to enrich your form page by including things like links, images, videos, and more. n8n will render the content with the rest of the form fields in the normal document flow.
Because custom HTML content is read-only, these fields aren't included in the form output data by default. To include the raw HTML content in the node output, provide a name for the data using the
Element Name
field.
The HTML field doesn't support
<script>
,
<style>
, or
<input>
elements.
Including hidden fields
#
It's possible to include fields in a form without displaying them to users. This is useful when you want to pass extra data to the form that doesn't require interactive user input.
To add fields that won't show up on the form, use the
Hidden Field
form element. There, you can define the
Field Name
and optionally provide a default value by filling out the
Field Value
.
When serving the form, you can pass values for hidden fields using
query parameters
.
Defining the form using JSON
#
Use
Define Form
>
Using JSON
to define the fields of your form with a
JSON array of objects
. Each object defines a single field by using a combination of these keys:
fieldLabel
: The label that appears above the input field.
fieldType
: Choose from
date
,
dropdown
,
email
,
file
,
number
,
password
,
text
, or
textarea
.
Use
date
to include a date picker in the form. Refer to
Date and time with Luxon
for more information on formatting dates.
When using
dropdown
, set the choices with
fieldOptions
(reference the example below). By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, set
multiselect
to
true
.
When using
file
, set
multipleFiles
to
true
to allow users to select more than one file. To define the file types to allow, set
acceptFileTypes
to a string containing a comma-separated list of file extensions (reference the example below).
placeholder
: Specify placeholder data for the field. You can use this for every
fieldType
except
dropdown
,
date
, and
file
.
requiredField
: Require users to complete this field on the form.

Form Ending
#
Use the
Form Ending
Page Type to end a form and either show a completion page, redirect the user to a URL, or display custom HTML or text. Only one Form Ending page displays per execution, even when n8n executes
multiple branches
that contain Form Ending nodes.
Choose between these options when using
On n8n Form Submission
:
Show Completion Screen
: Shows users a final screen to confirm that they submitted the form.
Fill in
Completion Title
to set the
h1
title on the form.
n8n displays the
Completion Message
as a subtitle below the main
h1
title on the form. Use
\n
or
<br>
to add a line break.
Select
Add option
and fill in
Completion Page Title
to set the page's title in the browser tab.
When using
Redirect to URL
, fill in the
URL
field with the page you want to redirect to when users complete the form.
Use
Show Text
to display a final page defined by arbitrary plain text and HTML. Fill in the
Text
field with the HTML or plain text content you wish to show.
Forms with branches
#
The n8n Form node executes and displays its associated form page whenever it receives data from a previous node. When building forms with n8n, to avoid confusion, it's important to understand how forms behave when branching occurs.
Workflows with mutually exclusive branches
#
Form workflows containing mutually exclusive branches work as expected. n8n will execute a single branch according to the submitted data and conditions you outline. As it executes, n8n will display each page in the branch, ending with an n8n Form node with the
Form Ending
page type.
This workflow demonstrates mutually exclusive branching. Each selection can only execute a single branch.
View workflow file
Workflows that may execute multiple branches
#
Form workflows that send data to multiple branches at the same time require more care. When multiple branches receive data during an execution (for example, from a
switch
node), n8n executes each branch that receives data
sequentially
. Upon reaching the end of one branch, the execution will move to the next branch with data.
n8n only executes a single
Form Ending
n8n Form node for each execution. When multiple branches of a form workflow receive data, n8n ignores all Form Ending nodes except for the one associated with the final branch.
This workflow may execute more than one branch during an execution. Here, n8n executes all valid branches sequentially. This impacts which n8n Form nodes n8n executes (in particular, which
Form Ending
node displays):

Node options
#
Select
Add Option
to view more configuration options:
Form Title
: The title for your form. n8n displays the
Form Title
as the webpage title and main
h1
title on the form.
Form Description
: The description for your form. n8n displays the
Form Description
as a subtitle below the main
h1
title on the form. This field supports HTML. Use
\n
or
<br>
to add a line break. The Form Description also populates the
HTML meta description
for the page.
Button Label
: The label to use for your form's submit button. n8n displays the
Button Label
as the name of the submit button.
Running the node
#
Build and test workflows
#
While building or testing a workflow, use the
Test URL
in the
n8n Form Trigger
. Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging.
There are two ways to test:
Select
Test Step
. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node and any previous nodes, but not the rest of the workflow.
Select
Test Workflow
. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.
Production workflows
#
When your workflow is ready, switch to using the n8n Form Trigger's
Production URL
by opening the trigger node and selecting the
Production URL
in the
From URLS
selector. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form.
When working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.
