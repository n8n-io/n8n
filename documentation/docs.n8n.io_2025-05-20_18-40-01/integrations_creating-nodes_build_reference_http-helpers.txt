HTTP request helper for node builders
#
n8n provides a flexible helper for making HTTP requests, which abstracts away most of the complexity.
Programmatic style only
The information in this document is for node building using the programmatic style. It doesn't apply to declarative style nodes.
Usage
#
Call the helper inside the
execute
function.

url
is required. The other fields are optional. The default method is
GET
.
Some notes about the possible fields:
body
: you can use a regular JavaScript object for JSON payload, a buffer for file uploads, an instance of FormData for
multipart/form-data
, and
URLSearchParams
for
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
.
headers
: a key-value pair.
If
body
is an instance of
FormData
then n8n adds
content-type: multipart/form-data
automatically.
If
body
is an instance of
URLSearchParams
, then n8n adds
content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
.
To override this behavior, set a
content-type
header.
arrayFormat
: if your query string contains an array of data, such as
const qs = {IDs: [15,17]}
, the value of
arrayFormat
defines how n8n formats it.
indices
(default):
{ a: ['b', 'c'] }
as
a[0]=b&a[1]=c
brackets
:
{ a: ['b', 'c'] }
as
a[]=b&a[]=c
repeat
:
{ a: ['b', 'c'] }
as
a=b&a=c
comma
:
{ a: ['b', 'c'] }
as
a=b,c
auth
: Used for Basic auth. Provide
username
and
password
. n8n recommends omitting this, and using
helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication(...)
instead.
disableFollowRedirect
: By default, n8n follows redirects. You can set this to true to prevent this from happening.
skipSslCertificateValidation
: Used for calling HTTPS services without proper certificate
returnFullResponse
: Instead of returning just the body, returns an object with more data in the following format:
{body: body, headers: object, statusCode: 200, statusMessage: 'OK'}
encoding
: n8n can detect the content type, but you can specify
arrayBuffer
to receive a Buffer you can read from and interact with.
Example
#
For an example, refer to the
Mattermost node
.
Deprecation of the previous helper
#
The previous helper implementation using
this.helpers.request(options)
used and exposed the
request-promise
library. This was removed in version 1.
To minimize incompatibility, n8n made a transparent conversion to another library called
Axios

Migration guide to the new helper
#
The new helper is much more robust, library agnostic, and easier to use.
New nodes should all use the new helper. You should strongly consider migrating existing custom nodes to the new helper. These are the main considerations when migrating:
Accepts
url
. Doesn't accept
uri
.
encoding: null
now must be
encoding: arrayBuffer
.
rejectUnauthorized: false
is now
skipSslCertificateValidation: true
Use
body
according to
content-type
headers to clarify the payload.
resolveWithFullResponse
is now
returnFullResponse
and has similar behavior
