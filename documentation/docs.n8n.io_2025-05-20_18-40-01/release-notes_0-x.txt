New features
#
Notable new features.
Resource mapper UI component
#
This release includes a new UI component, the resource mapper. This component is useful for node creators. If your node does insert, update, or upsert operations, you need to send data from the node in a format supported by the service you're integrating with. Often it's necessary to use a Set node before a node that sends data, to get the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node.
Refer to
Node user interface elements | Resource mapper
for guidance for node builders.

This is a bug fix release. It also contains a new feature to support user management without SMTP set up.
New features
#
Invite link for users on self-hosted n8n

0.210.1 introduces an invite link, which you can copy and send to users manually. n8n still recommends setting up SMTP, as this is needed for password resets.

security audit
feature. You can now run a security audit on your n8n instance, to detect common security issues.

For example, when using the Trello node, you can now search for a specific card by ID, URL, or do a free text search for card titles. Node builders can learn more about working with this new UI element in n8n's

This release includes several major new features, including:
The community nodes repository: a new way to build and share nodes.
Data pinning and data mapping: accelerate workflow development with better data manipulation functionality.
New features
#
Community nodes repository
#
This release introduces the
community node repository
. This allows developers to build and share nodes as npm packages. Users can install community-built nodes directly in n8n.
Data pinning
#
Data pinning
allows you to freeze and edit data during workflow development. Data pinning means saving the output data of a node, and using the saved data instead of fetching fresh data in future workflow executions. This avoids repeated API calls when developing a workflow, reducing calls to external systems, and speeding up workflow development.
Data mapping
#
This release introduces a drag and drop interface for
data mapping
, as a quick way to map data without using expressions.
Simplify authentication setup for node creators
#
This release introduces a simpler way of handling authorization when building a node. All credentials should now contain an
authenticate
property that dictates how the credential is used in a request.
n8n has also simplified authentication types: instead of specifying an authentication type and using the correct interface, you can now set the type as
"generic"
, and use the
IAuthenticateGeneric
interface.
You can use this approach for any authentication method where data is sent in the header, body, or query string. This includes methods like bearer and basic auth. You can't use this approach for more complex authentication types that require multiple calls, or for methods that don't pass authentication data. This includes OAuth.
For an example of the new authentication syntax, refer to n8n's
Asana node

This release adds support for reusing existing credentials in the HTTP Request node, making it easier to do custom operation with APIs where n8n already has an integration.
The release also includes improvements to the nodes view, giving better detail about incoming data, as well as some bug fixes.
New features
#
Credential reuse for custom API operations
#
n8n supplies hundreds of nodes, allowing you to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the HTTP Request node.
One of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication. To simplify this, n8n now provides a way to use existential credential types (credentials associated with n8n nodes) in the HTTP Request node.

Custom API operations

Release date:

This release adds support for node versioning, along with node enhancements and bug fixes.
New features
#
Node versioning
#
0.175.0 adds support for a lightweight method of node versioning. One node can contain multiple versions, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature, change the
version
parameter in your node to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version. You can then access the version parameter with
@version
in your
displayOptions
(to control which version n8n displays). You can also query the version in your
execute
function using
const nodeVersion = this.getNode().typeVersion;
.
Node enhancements
#
Google Sheets node
: n8n now handles header names formatted as JSON paths.
Microsoft Dynamics CRM node
: add support for regions other than North America.
Telegram node
: add support for querying chat administrators.

#

Highlights

Luxon and JMESPath

#
We've added two new variables to simplify working with date and time in expressions:
$now
: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to DateTime.now().
$today
: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).
Negative operations in If and Switch nodes
