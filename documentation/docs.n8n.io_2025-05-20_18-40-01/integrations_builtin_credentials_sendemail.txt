Simple Message Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a standard protocol for sending and receiving email. Most email providers offer instructions on setting up their service with SMTP. Refer to your provider's SMTP instructions.
Using SMTP account
#
To configure this credential, you'll need:
A
User
email address
A
Password
: This may be the user's password or an app password. Refer to the documentation for your email provider.
The
Host
: The SMTP host address for your email provider, often formatted as
smtp.<provider>.com
. Check with your provider.
A
Port
number: The default is port
465
, commonly used for SSL. Other common ports are
587
for TLS or
25
for no encryption. Check with your provider.
SSL/TLS
: When turned on, SMTP will use SSL/TLS.
Disable STARTTLS
: When SSL/TLS is disabled, the SMTP server can still try to
upgrade the TCP connection using STARTTLS
. Turning this on prevents that behaviour.
Client Host Name
: If needed by your provider, add a client host name. This name identifies the client to the server.
