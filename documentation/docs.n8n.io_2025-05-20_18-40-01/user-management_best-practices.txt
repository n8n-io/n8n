Best practices for user management
#
This page contains advice on best practices relating to user management in n8n.
All platforms
#
n8n recommends that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see all workflows, but there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.
Users must be careful not to edit the same workflow simultaneously. It's possible to do it, but the users will overwrite each other's changes.
To move workflows between accounts, export the workflow as JSON, then import it to the new account. Note that this action loses the workflow history.
Webhook paths must be unique across the entire instance. This means each webhook path must be unique for all workflows and all users. By default, n8n generates a long random value for the webhook path, but users can edit this to their own custom path. If two users set the same path value:
The path works for the first workflow that's run or activated.
Other workflows will error if they try to run with the same path.

If you run n8n behind a reverse proxy, set the following environment variables so that n8n generates emails with the correct URL:
N8N_HOST
N8N_PORT
N8N_PROTOCOL
N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL
More information on these variables is available in
