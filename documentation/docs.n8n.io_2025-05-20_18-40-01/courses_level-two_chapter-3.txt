Merging and splitting data
#
In this chapter, you will learn how to merge and split data, and in what cases it might be useful to perform these operations.
Merging data
#
In some cases, you might need to merge (combine) and process data from different sources.
Merging data can involve:
Creating one data set from multiple sources.
Synchronizing data between multiple systems. This could include removing duplicate data or updating data in one system when it changes in another.
One-way vs. two-way sync
In a one-way sync, data is synchronized in one direction. One system serves as the single source of truth. When information changes in that main system, it automatically changes in the secondary system; but if information changes in the secondary system, the changes aren't reflected in the main system.
In a two-way sync, data is synchronized in both directions (between both systems). When information changes in either of the two systems, it automatically changes in the other one as well.
This blog tutorial
explains how to sync data one-way and two-way between two CRMs.
In n8n, you can merge data from two different nodes using the
Merge node
, which provides several merging options:
Append
Combine
Merge by Fields
: requires input fields to match on
Merge by Position
Combine all possible combinations
Choose Branch
Notice that Combine > Merge by Fields requires you enter input fields to match on. These fields should contain identical values between the data sources so n8n can properly match data together. In the
Merge node
, they're called
Input 1 Field
and
Input 2 Field
.
Property Input fields in the Merge node
Property Input in dot notation
If you want to reference nested values in the
Merge node
parameters
Input 1 Field
and
Input 2 Field
, you need to enter the property key in dot-notation format (as text, not as an expression).
Note
You can also find the
Merge node
under the alias Join. This might be more intuitive if you're familiar with SQL joins.
Merge Exercise
#
Build a workflow that merges data from the Customer Datastore node and Code node.
Add a
Merge node
that takes
Input 1
from a
Customer Datastore node
and
Input 2
from a
Code node
.
In the
Customer Datastore node
, run the operation
Get All People
.
In the
Code node
, create an array of two objects with three properties:
name
,
language
, and
country
, where the property
country
has two sub-properties
code
and
name
.
Fill out the values of these properties with the information of two characters from the Customer Database.
For example, Jay Gatsby's language is English and country name is United States.
In the
Merge node
, try out different merge options.
Show me the solution
The workflow for this exercise looks like this:
Workflow exercise for merging data
If you merge data with the option
Keep Matches
using the name as the input fields to match, the result should look like this (note this example only contains Jay Gatsby; yours might look different depending on which characters you selected):
Output of Merge node with option to keep matches
To check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:

Looping
#
In some cases, you might need to perform the same operation on each element of an array or each data item (for example sending a message to every contact in your address book). In technical terms, you need to iterate through the data (with loops).
n8n generally handles this repetitive processing automatically, as the nodes run once for each item, so you don't need to build loops into your workflows.
However, there are some
exceptions of nodes and operations
that will require you to build a loop into your workflow.
To
create a loop in an n8n workflow
, you need to connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node, and add an
If node
to check when to stop the loop.
Splitting data in batches
#
If you need to process large volumes of incoming data, execute the
Code node
multiple times, or avoid API rate limits, it's best to split the data into batches (groups) and process these batches.
For these processes, use the
Loop Over Items node
. This node splits input data into a specified batch size and, with each iteration, returns a predefined amount of data.
Execution of Loop Over Items node
The
Loop Over Items node
stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow, so it's not necessary to add an
If node
to stop the loop.
Loop/Batch Exercise
#
Build a workflow that reads the RSS feed from Medium and dev.to. The workflow should consist of three nodes:
A
Code node
that returns the URLs of the RSS feeds of Medium (
https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io
) and dev.to (
https://dev.to/feed/n8n
).
A
Loop Over Items node
with
Batch Size: 1
, that takes in the inputs from the
Code node
and
RSS Read node
and iterates over the items.
An
RSS Read node
that gets the URL of the Medium RSS feed, passed as an expression:
{{ $json.url }}
.
The
RSS Read node
is one of the
exception nodes
which processes only the first item it receives, so the
Loop Over Items node
is necessary for iterating over multiple items.
Show me the solution
Add a
Code Node
. You can format the code in several ways, one way is:
Set
Mode
to
Run Once for All Items
.
Set
Language
to
JavaScript
.
Copy the code below and paste it into the JavaScript Code editor:

}
},
{
json
:
{
url
:
'https://dev.to/feed/n8n'
}
}
]
return
urls
;
Add a
Loop Over Items node
connected to the
Code node
.
Set
Batch Size
to
1
.
The
Loop Over Items node
automatically adds a node called "Replace Me". Replace that node with an
RSS Read node
.
Set the
URL
to use the url from the Code Node:
{{ $json.url }}
.
The workflow for this exercise looks like this:
