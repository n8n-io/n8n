Use the Edit Image node to manipulate and edit images.
Dependencies
If you aren't running n8n on Docker, you need to install
GraphicsMagick
.
You need to use a node such as the
Read/Write Files from Disk
node or the
HTTP Request
node to pass the image file as a data property to the Edit Image node.
