Ollama Chat Model node common issues
#
Here are some common errors and issues with the
Ollama Chat Model node
and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Processing parameters
#
The Ollama Chat Model node is a
sub-node
. Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.
Most nodes, including
root nodes
, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression
{{ $json.name }}
resolves to each name in turn.
In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression
{{ $json.name }}
always resolves to the first name.
Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance
#
The Ollama Chat Model node is only designed to connect to a locally hosted Ollama instance. It doesn't include the authentication features you'd need to connect to a remotely hosted Ollama instance.
To use the Ollama Chat Model, follow the
Ollama credentials instructions
to set up Ollama locally and configure the instance URL in n8n.
Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker
#
The Ollama Chat Model node connects to a locally hosted Ollama instance using the base URL defined by
Ollama credentials
. When you run either n8n or Ollama in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Ollama.
Ollama typically listens for connections on
localhost
, the local network address. In Docker, by default, each container has its own
localhost
which is only accessible from within the container. If either n8n or Ollama are running in containers, they won't be able to connect over
localhost
.
The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.
If only Ollama is in Docker
#
If only Ollama is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to
0.0.0.0
inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).
When running the container,
publish the ports
with the
-p
flag. By default, Ollama runs on port 11434, so your Docker command should look like this:
1
docker
run
-d
-v
ollama:/root/.ollama
-p
11434
:11434
--name
ollama
ollama/ollama
When configuring
Ollama credentials
, the
localhost
address should work without a problem (set the
base URL
to
http://localhost:11434
).
If only n8n is in Docker
#
If only n8n is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to
0.0.0.0
on the host.
If you are running n8n in Docker on
Linux
, use the
--add-host
flag to map
host.docker.internal
to
host-gateway
when you start the container. For example:
1
docker
run
-it
--rm
--add-host
host.docker.internal:host-gateway
--name
n8n
-p
5678
:5678
-v
n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n
docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.
When configuring
Ollama credentials
, use
host.docker.internal
as the host address instead of
localhost
. For example, to bind to the default port 11434, you could set the base URL to
http://host.docker.internal:11434
.
If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers
#
If both n8n and Ollama are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.
Configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to
0.0.0.0
inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).
When configuring
Ollama credentials
, use the Ollama container's name as the host address instead of
localhost
. For example, if you call the Ollama container
my-ollama
and it listens on the default port 11434, you would set the base URL to
http://my-ollama:11434
.
If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container
#
If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the
localhost
address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure Ollama to listen on localhost and configure the base URL in the
Ollama credentials in n8n
to use localhost:
http://localhost:11434
.
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434
#
This error occurs when your computer has IPv6 enabled, but Ollama is listening to an IPv4 address.
To fix this, change the base URL in your
Ollama credentials
to connect to
127.0.0.1
, the IPv4-specific local address, instead of the
localhost
alias that can resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6:
http://127.0.0.1:11434
.
