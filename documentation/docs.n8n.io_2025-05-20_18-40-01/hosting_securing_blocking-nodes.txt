Block access to nodes
#
For security reasons, you may want to block your users from accessing or working with specific n8n nodes. This is helpful if your users might be untrustworthy.
Use the
NODES_EXCLUDE
environment variable to prevent your users from accessing specific nodes.
Exclude nodes
#
Update your
NODES_EXCLUDE
environment variable to include an array of strings containing any nodes you want to block your users from using.
For example, setting the variable this way:
1
NODES_EXCLUDE: "[\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\", \"n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile\"]"
Blocks the
Execute Command
and
Read/Write Files from Disk
nodes.
Your n8n users won't be able to search for or use these nodes.
