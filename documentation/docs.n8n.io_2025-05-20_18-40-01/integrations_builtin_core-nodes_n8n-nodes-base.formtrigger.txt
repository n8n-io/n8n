n8n Form Trigger node
#
Use the n8n Form trigger to start a workflow when a user submits a form, taking the input data from the form. The node generates the form web page for you to use.
You can add more pages to continue the form with the
n8n Form
node.
Build and test workflows
#
While building or testing a workflow, use the
Test URL
. Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging.
There are two ways to test:
Select
Test Step
. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node, but not the rest of the workflow.
Select
Test Workflow
. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.
Production workflows
#
When your workflow is ready, switch to using the
Production URL
. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form.
When working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.
Set default selections with query parameters
#
You can set the initial values for fields by using
query parameters
with the initial URL provided by the n8n Form Trigger. Every
page in the form
receives the same query parameters sent to the n8n Form Trigger URL.
Only for production
Query parameters are only available when using the form in production mode. n8n won't populate field values from query parameters in testing mode.
When using query parameters,
percent-encode
any field names or values that use special characters. This ensures n8n uses the initial values for the given fields. You can use tools like
URL Encode/Decode
to format your query parameters using percent-encoding.
As an example, imagine you have a form with the following properties:
Production URL:
https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form
Fields:
name
:
Jane Doe
email
:
jane.doe@example.com
With query parameters and percent-encoding, you could use the following URL to set initial field values to the data above:
1
https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form?email=jane.doe%40example.com&name=Jane%20Doe
Here, percent-encoding replaces the at-symbol (
@
) with the string
%40
and the space character (
) with the string
%20
. This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on.
Node parameters
#
These are the main node configuration fields:
Authentication
#
Basic Auth
None
Using basic auth
#
To configure this credential, you'll need:
The
Username
you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting.
The
Password
that goes with that username.
Form URLs
#
The Form Trigger node has two URLs:
Test URL
and
Production URL
. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel. Select
Test URL
or
Production URL
to toggle which URL n8n displays.
Test URL
: n8n registers a test webhook when you select
Test Step
or
Test Workflow
, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
Production URL
: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution. Select the
Executions
tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.
Form Path
#
Set a custom slug for the form.
Form Title
#
Enter the title for your form. n8n displays the
Form Title
as the webpage title and main
h1
title on the form.
Form Description
#
Enter the description for your form. n8n displays the
Form Description
as a subtitle below the main
h1
title on the form. Use
\n
or
<br>
to add a line break.
Form Elements
#
Create the question fields for your form. Select
Add Form Element
to add a new field.
Every field has the following settings:
Field Label
: Enter the label that appears above the input field.

You can include elements like links, images, video, and more. You can't include
<script>
,
<style>
, or
<input>
elements.
By default, Custom HTML fields aren't included in the node output. To include the Custom HTML content in the output, fill out the associated
Element Name
field.
Select
Date
to include a date picker in the form. Refer to
Date and time with Luxon
for more information on formatting dates.

Field Value
parameter or pass values for the field using
query parameters
.
Required Field
: Turn on to require users to complete this field on the form.
Respond When
#
Choose when n8n sends a response to the form submission. You can respond when:
Form Is Submitted
: Send a response to the user as soon as they submit the form.
Workflow Finishes
: Use this if you want the workflow to complete its execution before you send a response to the user. If the workflow errors, it sends a response to the user telling them there was a problem submitting the form.
Node options
#
Select
Add Option
to view more configuration options:
Append n8n Attribution
: Turn off to hide the
Form automated with n8n
attribute at the bottom of the form.

Respond With
>
Form Submitted Text
: Show a message to the user.
Respond With
>
Redirect URL
: Send the user to a new page.
Ignore Bots
: Turn on to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers.
Use Workflow Timezone
: Turn on to use the timezone in the
Workflow settings
instead of UTC (default). This affects the value of the
submittedAt
timestamp in the node output.
