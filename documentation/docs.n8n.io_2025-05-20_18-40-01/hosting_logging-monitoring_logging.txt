Logging in n8n
#
Logging is an important feature for debugging. n8n uses the
winston
logging library.
Log streaming
n8n Self-hosted Enterprise tier includes
Log streaming
, in addition to the logging options described in this document.
Setup
#
To set up logging in n8n, you need to set the following environment variables (you can also set the values in the
configuration file
)
Setting in the configuration file
Using environment variables
Description
n8n.log.level
N8N_LOG_LEVEL
The log output level. The available options are (from lowest to highest level) are error, warn, info, and debug. The default value is
info
. You can learn more about these options
here
.
n8n.log.output
N8N_LOG_OUTPUT
Where to output logs. The available options are
console
and
file
. Multiple values can be used separated by a comma (
,
).
console
is used by default.
n8n.log.file.location
N8N_LOG_FILE_LOCATION
The log file location, used only if log output is set to file. By default,
<n8nFolderPath>/logs/n8n.log
is used.
n8n.log.file.maxsize
N8N_LOG_FILE_SIZE_MAX
The maximum size (in MB) for each log file. By default, n8n uses 16 MB.
n8n.log.file.maxcount
N8N_LOG_FILE_COUNT_MAX
The maximum number of log files to keep. The default value is 100. This value should be set when using workers.

Log levels
#
n8n uses standard log levels to report:
silent
: outputs nothing at all
error
: outputs only errors and nothing else
warn
: outputs errors and warning messages
info
: contains useful information about progress
debug
: the most verbose output. n8n outputs a lot of information to help you debug issues.
Development
#
During development, adding log messages is a good practice. It assists in debugging errors. To configure logging for development, follow the guide below.
Implementation details
#
n8n uses the
LoggerProxy
class, located in the
workflow
package. Calling the
LoggerProxy.init()
by passing in an instance of
Logger
, initializes the class before the usage.
The initialization process happens only once. The
start.ts
file already does this process for you. If you are creating a new command from scratch, you need to initialize the
LoggerProxy
class.
Once the
Logger
implementation gets created in the
cli
package, it can be obtained by calling the
getInstance
convenience method from the exported module.
Check the
start.ts
file to learn more about how this process works.
Adding logs
#
Once the
LoggerProxy
class gets initialized in the project, you can import it to any other file and add logs.
Convenience methods are provided for all logging levels, so new logs can be added whenever needed using the format
Logger.<logLevel>('<message>', ...meta)
, where
meta
represents any additional properties desired beyond
message
.
In the example above, we use the standard log levels described
above
. The
message
argument is a string, and
meta
is a data object.

// You have to import the LoggerProxy. We rename it to Logger to make it easier
import
{
LoggerProxy
as
Logger
}
from
'n8n-workflow'
;
// Info-level logging of a trigger function, with workflow name and workflow ID as additional metadata properties
Logger
.
info
(
`Polling trigger initiated for workflow "
${
workflow
.
name
}
"`
,
{
workflowName
:
workflow
.
name
,
workflowId
:
workflow
.
id
});
When creating new loggers, some useful standards to keep in mind are:
Craft log messages to be as human-readable as possible. For example, always wrap names in quotes.
Duplicating information in the log message and metadata, like workflow name in the above example, can be useful as messages are easier to search and metadata enables easier filtering.
Include multiple IDs (for example,
executionId
,
workflowId
, and
sessionId
) throughout all logs.
Use node types instead of node names (or both) as this is more consistent, and so easier to search.
Front-end logs
#
As of now, front-end logs aren't available. Using
Logger
or
LoggerProxy
would yield errors in the
editor-ui
package. This functionality will get implemented in the future versions.
