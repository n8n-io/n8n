Postgres node
#
Use the Postgres node to automate work in Postgres, and integrate Postgres with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Postgres features, including executing queries, as well as inserting and updating rows in a database.
On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Postgres node supports and links to more resources.
Credentials
Refer to
Postgres credentials
for guidance on setting up authentication.
This node can be used as an AI tool
This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the
AI tool parameters documentation

n8n provides a trigger node for Postgres. You can find the trigger node docs
here
.
Use query parameters
#
When creating a query to run on a Postgres database, you can use the
Query Parameters
field in the
Options
section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.
For example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
[
{
"email"
:
"alex@example.com"
,
"name"
:
"Alex"
,
"age"
:
21
},
{
"email"
:
"jamie@example.com"
,
"name"
:
"Jamie"
,
"age"
:
33
}
]
You can write a query like:
1
SELECT
*
FROM
$
1
:
name
WHERE
email
=
$
2
;
Then in
Query Parameters
, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:
1
2
// users is an example table name
{{
[
'users'
,
$json
.
email
]
}}
