Ghost credentials
#
You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:
Ghost
Prerequisites
#
Create a
Ghost
account.
Supported authentication methods
#
Admin API key
Content API key
The keys are generated following the same steps, but the authorization flows and key format are different, so n8n stores the credentials separately. The Content API uses an API key; the Admin API uses an API key to generate a token for authentication.
