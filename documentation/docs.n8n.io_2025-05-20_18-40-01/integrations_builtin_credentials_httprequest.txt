HTTP Request credentials
#
You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:
HTTP Request
HTTP Request Tool (legacy)
Prerequisites
#
You must use the authentication method required by the app or service you want to query.
If you need to secure the authentication with an SSL certificate, refer to
Provide an SSL certificate
for the information you'll need.
Supported authentication methods
#
Predefined credential type
Basic auth (generic credential type)
Custom auth (generic credential type)
Digest auth (generic credential type)
Header auth (generic credential type)
Bearer auth (generic credential type)
OAuth1 (generic credential type)
OAuth2 (generic credential type)
Query auth (generic credential type)
Refer to
HTTP authentication
for more information relating to generic credential types.
Predefined credential types
n8n recommends using predefined credential types whenever there's a credential type available for the service you want to connect to. It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.
You can use
Predefined credential types
to perform custom operations with some APIs where n8n has a node for the platform. For example, n8n has an Asana node, and supports using your Asana credentials in the HTTP Request node. Refer to
Custom operations
for more information.
Using predefined credential type
#
To use a predefined credential type:
Open your HTTP Request node, or add a new one to your workflow.
In
Authentication
, select
Predefined Credential Type
.
In
Credential Type
, select the API you want to use.
In
Credential for
<API name>
, you can:
Select an existing credential for that platform, if available.
Select
Create New
to create a new credential.
Refer to
Custom API operations
for more information.
Using basic auth
#
Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports basic authentication.
To configure this credential, enter:
The
Username
you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting
The
Password
that goes with that username
Using digest auth
#
Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports digest authentication.
To configure this credential, enter:
The
Username
you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting
The
Password
that goes with that username
Using header auth
#
Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports header authentication.
To configure this credential, enter:
The header
Name
you need to pass to the app or service your HTTP request is targeting
The
Value
for the header

HTTP headers
Using bearer auth
#
Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports bearer authentication. This authentication type is actually just header authentication with the
Name
set to
Authorization
and the
Value
set to
Bearer <token>
.
To configure this credential, enter:
The
Bearer Token
you need to pass to the app or service your HTTP request is targeting
Read more about
bearer authentication
.
Using OAuth1
#
Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth1 authentication.
To configure this credential, enter:
An
Authorization URL
: Also known as the Resource Owner Authorization URI. This URL typically ends in
/oauth1/authorize
. The temporary credentials are sent here to prompt a user to complete authorization.
An
Access Token URL
: This is the URI used for the initial request for temporary credentials. This URL typically ends in
/oauth1/request
or
/oauth1/token
.
A
Consumer Key
: Also known as the client key, like a username. This specifies the
oauth_consumer_key
to use for the call.
A
Consumer Secret
: Also known as the client secret, like a password.
A
Request Token URL
: This is the URI used to switch from temporary credentials to long-lived credentials after authorization. This URL typically ends in
/oauth1/access
.
Select the
Signature Method
the auth handshake uses. This specifies the
oauth_signature_method
to use for the call. Options include:
HMAC-SHA1
HMAC-SHA256
HMAC-SHA512
For most OAuth1 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration to generate the values for most of these fields. Use the
OAuth Redirect URL
in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.
Read more about
OAuth1
and the
OAuth1 authorization flow
.
Using OAuth2
#
Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth2 authentication.
Requirements to configure this credential depend on the
Grant Type
selected. Refer to
OAuth Grant Types
for more information on each grant type.
For most OAuth2 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration. Use the
OAuth Redirect URL
in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.
Read more about
OAuth2
.
Authorization Code grant type
#
Use Authorization Code grant type to exchange an authorization code for an access token. The auth flow uses the redirect URL to return the user to the client. Then the application gets the authorization code from the URL and uses it to request an access token. Refer to
Authorization Code Request
for more information.
To configure this credential, select
Authorization Code
as the
Grant Type
.
Then enter:
An
Authorization URL
An
Access Token URL
A
Client ID
: The ID or username to log in with.
A
Client Secret
: The secret or password used to log in with.
Optional:
Enter one or more
Scope
s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.
Optional:
Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as
Auth URI Query Parameters
.
An
Authentication
type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
Header
: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
Body
: Send the credentials in the body of the request.
Optional:
Choose whether to
Ignore SSL Issues
. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.
Client Credentials grant type
#
Use the Client Credentials grant type when applications request an access token to access their own resources, not on behalf of a user. Refer to
Client Credentials
for more information.
To configure this credential, select
Client Credentials
as the
Grant Type
.
Then enter:
An
Access Token URL
: The URL to hit to begin the OAuth2 flow. Typically this URL ends in
/token
.
A
Client ID
: The ID or username to use to log in to the client.
A
Client Secret
: The secret or password used to log in to the client.
Optional:
Enter one or more
Scope
s for the credential. Most services don't support scopes for Client Credentials grant types; only enter scopes here if yours does.
An
Authentication
type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
Header
: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.

.
An
Authentication
type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
Header
: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
Body
: Send the credentials in the body of the request.
Optional:
Choose whether to
Ignore SSL Issues
. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.
Using query auth
#
Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as a single key/value query parameter. (For multiple query parameters, use
Custom Auth
.)
To configure this credential, enter:
A query parameter key or
Name
A query parameter
Value
Using custom auth
#
Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as multiple key/value query parameters or you need more flexibility than the other generic auth options.
The
Custom Auth
credential expects JSON data to define your credential. You can use
headers
,
qs
,
body
or a mix. Review the examples below to get started.
Sending two headers

	"headers": {
		"api-version": "202404"
	},
	"qs": {
		"apikey": "my-api-key"
	}
}
Provide an SSL certificate
#
You can send an SSL certificate with your HTTP request. Create the SSL certificate as a separate credential for use by the node:
In the HTTP Request node
Settings
, turn on
SSL Certificates
.
On the
Parameters
tab, add an existing SSL Certificate credential to
Credential for SSL Certificates
or create a new one.
To configure your SSL Certificates credential, you'll need to add:
The Certificate Authority
CA
bundle
The
Certificate
(CRT): May also appear as a Public Key, depending on who your issuing CA was and how they format the cert
The
Private Key
(KEY)
Optional:
If the
Private Key
is encrypted, enter a
Passphrase
for the private key.
If your SSL certificate is in a single file (such as a
.pfx
file), you'll need to open the file to copy details from it to paste into the appropriate fields:
Enter the Public Key/CRT as the
Certificate
Enter the
Private Key
/KEY in that field
