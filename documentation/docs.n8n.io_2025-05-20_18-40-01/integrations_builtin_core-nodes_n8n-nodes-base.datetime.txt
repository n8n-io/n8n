Date & Time
#
The Date & Time node manipulates date and time data and convert it to different formats.
Timezone settings
The node relies on the timezone setting. n8n uses either:
The workflow timezone, if set. Refer to
Workflow settings
for more information.
The n8n instance timezone, if the workflow timezone isn't set. The default is
America/New York
for self-hosted instances. n8n Cloud tries to detect the instance owner's timezone when they sign up, falling back to GMT as the default. Self-hosted users can change the instance setting using
Environment variables
. Cloud admins can change the instance timezone in the
Admin dashboard
.
Date and time in other nodes
You can work with data and time in the Code node, and in expressions in any node. n8n supports Luxon to help work with date and time in JavaScript. Refer to
Date and time with Luxon
for more information.

Date
here so the node can process it properly. Use Luxon's
special tokens
to enter the format. Tokens are case-sensitive
Use Workflow Timezone

Get Time Between Dates options
#
The Get Time Between Dates operation includes the
Include Input Fields
option as well as an
Output as ISO String
option. If you leave this option off, each unit you selected will return its own time difference calculation, for example:
1
2
3
4
timeDifference
years : 1
months : 3
days : 13
If you turn on the
Output as ISO String
option, the node formats the output as a single ISO duration string, for example:
P1Y3M13D
.
ISO duration format displays a format as
P<n>Y<n>M<n>DT<n>H<n>M<n>S
.
<n>
is the number for the unit after it.
P = period (duration). It begins all ISO duration strings.
Y = years
M = months
W = weeks
D = days
T = delineator between dates and times, used to avoid confusion between months and minutes
H = hours
M = minutes
S = seconds
Milliseconds don't get their own unit, but instead are decimal seconds. For example, 2.1 milliseconds is
0.0021S
.
