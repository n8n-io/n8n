Node codex files
#
The codex file contains metadata about your node. This file is the JSON file at the root of your node. For example, the
HttpBin.node.json
file in the n8n starter.
The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named
MyNode.node.ts
, the codex would be named
MyNode.node.json
.
Parameter
Description
node
Includes the node name. Must start with
n8n-nodes-base.
. For example,
n8n-nodes-base.openweatherapi
.
nodeVersion
The node version. This should have the same value as the
version
parameter in your main node file. For example,
"1.0"
.

The codex file version. The current version is
"1.0"
.
categories
The settings in the
categories
array determine which category n8n adds your node to in the GUI. See
Node categories
for more information.
resources
The
resources
object contains links to your node documentation. n8n automatically adds help links to credentials and nodes in the GUI.
Node categories
#
You can define one or more categories in your node configuration JSON. This helps n8n put the node in the correct category in the nodes panel.
Choose from these categories:
Data & Storage
Finance & Accounting
Marketing & Content
Productivity
Miscellaneous
Sales
Development
Analytics
Communication
Utility
You must match the syntax. For example,
Data & Storage
not
