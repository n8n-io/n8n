Hosting n8n on Azure
#
This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Azure. It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.
Prerequisites
#
You need
The Azure command line tool
Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites
Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:
Setting up and configuring servers and containers
Managing application resources and scaling
Securing servers and applications
Configuring n8n
n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends
n8n Cloud
.
Latest and Next versions
n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The
latest
version is for production use.
next
is the most recent release. You should treat
next
as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the
forum
.
Current
latest
: 1.93.0
Current
next
: 1.94.0
Hosting options
#
Azure offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including Azure Container Instances (optimized for running containers), Linux Virtual Machines, and Azure Kubernetes Service (containers running with Kubernetes).
This guide uses the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.
The steps in this guide use a mix of the Azure UI and command line tool, but you can use either to accomplish most tasks.
Open the Azure Kubernetes Service
#
From
the Azure portal
select
Kubernetes services
.
Create a cluster
#
From the Kubernetes services page, select
Create
>
Create a Kubernetes cluster
.
You can select any of the configuration options that suit your needs, then select
Create
when done.
Set Kubectl context
#
The remainder of the steps in this guide require you to set the Azure instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and then the
Connect
button. The resulting code snippets shows the steps to paste and run into a terminal to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new cluster.
Clone configuration repository
#
Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from
this repository
. The following steps tell you which file configures what and what you need to change.
Clone the repository with the following command:
1
git
clone
https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git
-b
azure
And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:
1
cd
azure
Configure Postgres
#
For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.
Configure volume for persistent storage
#
To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default storage class is suitable for this purpose and is defined in the
postgres-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml
manifest.
Specialized storage classes
If you have specialised or higher requirements for storage classes,
read more on the options Azure offers in the documentation
.
Postgres environment variables
#
Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.
The example
postgres-secret.yaml
file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database..
The
postgres-deployment.yaml
manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.
Configure n8n
#
Create a volume for file storage
#
While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for:
Using nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node.
If you want to persist
manual n8n encryption keys
between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.
The
n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml
manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the
volumes
section of the
n8n-deployment.yaml
manifest.

Pod resources
#
Kubernetes lets you
optionally specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the
resources
section of the
n8n-deployment.yaml
file:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
…
resources
:
requests
:
memory
:
"250Mi"
limits
:
memory
:
"500Mi"
…
This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:
Start
: 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
Pro (10k executions)
: 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
Pro (50k executions)
: 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable
Optional: Environment variables
#
You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.
Create an
n8n-secret.yaml
file. Refer to
Environment variables
for n8n environment variables details.
Deployments
#
The two deployment manifests (
n8n-deployment.yaml
and
postgres-deployment.yaml
) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.
The manifests define the following:
Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
Define the container image to use
Set resource consumption limits with the
resources
object
The
volumes
defined earlier and
volumeMounts
to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.
Services
#
The two service manifests (
postgres-service.yaml
and
n8n-service.yaml
) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively.
Send to Kubernetes cluster
#
Send all the manifests to the cluster with the following command:
1
kubectl
apply
-f
.
Namespace error
You may see an error message about not finding an "n8n" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:
1
kubectl
apply
-f
namespace.yaml
Set up DNS
#
n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the n8n service. Find the IP address of the n8n service from the
Services & ingresses
menu item of the cluster you want to use under the
External IP
column. You need to add the n8n port, "5678" to the URL.
Static IP addresses with AKS
Read this tutorial
for more details on how to use a static IP address with AKS.
Delete resources
#
Remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:
1
kubectl
delete
-f
.
