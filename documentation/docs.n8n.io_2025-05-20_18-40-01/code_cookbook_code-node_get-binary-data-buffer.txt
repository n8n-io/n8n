Get the binary data buffer
#
The binary data buffer contains all the binary file data processed by a workflow. You need to access it if you want to perform operations on the binary data, such as:
Manipulating the data: for example, adding column headers to a CSV file.
Using the data in calculations: for example, calculating a hash value based on it.
Complex HTTP requests: for example, combining file upload with sending other data formats.
Not available in Python
getBinaryDataBuffer()
isn't supported when using Python.
You can access the buffer using n8n's
getBinaryDataBuffer()
function:
1
2
3

/*
* itemIndex: number. The index of the item in the input data.
* binaryPropertyName: string. The name of the binary property.
* The default in the Read/Write File From Disk node is 'data'.
*/
let
binaryDataBufferItem
=
await
this
.
helpers
.
getBinaryDataBuffer
(
itemIndex
,
binaryPropertyName
);
For example:
1
2
let
binaryDataBufferItem
=
await
this
.
helpers
.
getBinaryDataBuffer
(
0
,
'data'
);
// Returns the data in the binary buffer for the first input item
You should always use the
getBinaryDataBuffer()
function, and avoid using older methods of directly accessing the buffer, such as targeting it with expressions like
items[0].binary.data.data
.
