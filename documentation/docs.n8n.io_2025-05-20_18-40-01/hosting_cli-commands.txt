CLI commands for n8n
#
n8n includes a CLI (command line interface), allowing you to perform actions using the CLI rather than the n8n editor. These include starting workflows, and exporting and importing workflows and credentials.
Running CLI commands
#
You can use CLI commands with self-hosted n8n. Depending on how you choose to install n8n, there are differences in how to run the commands:
npm: the
n8n
command is directly available. The documentation uses this in the examples below.
Docker: the
n8n
command is available within your Docker container:
1
docker
exec
-u
node
-it
<n8n-container-name>
<n8n-cli-command>
Start a workflow
#
You can start workflows directly using the CLI.
Execute a saved workflow by its ID:
1
n8n
execute
--id
<ID>
Change the active status of a workflow
#
You can change the active status of a workflow using the CLI.
Restart required
These commands operate on your n8n database. If you execute them while n8n is running, the changes don't take effect until you restart n8n.
Set the active status of a workflow by its ID to false:
1
n8n
update:workflow
--id
=
<ID>
--active
=
false
Set the active status of a workflow by its ID to true:
1
n8n
update:workflow
--id
=
<ID>
--active
=
true
Set the active status to false for all the workflows:
1
n8n
update:workflow
--all
--active
=
false
Set the active status to true for all the workflows:
1
n8n
update:workflow
--all
--active
=
true
Export workflows and credentials
#
You can export your workflows and credentials from n8n using the CLI.
Command flags:
Flag
Description
--help
Help prompt.
--all
Exports all workflows/credentials.
--backup
Sets --all --pretty --separate for backups. You can optionally set --output.
--id
The ID of the workflow to export.
--output
Outputs file name or directory if using separate files.
--pretty
Formats the output in an easier to read fashion.
--separate
Exports one file per workflow (useful for versioning). Must set a directory using --output.
--decrypted
Exports the credentials in a plain text format.
Workflows
#
Export all your workflows to the standard output (terminal):
1
n8n
export:workflow
--all
Export a workflow by its ID and specify the output file name:
1
n8n
export:workflow
--id
=
<ID>
--output
=
file.json
Export all workflows to a specific directory in a single file:
1
n8n
export:workflow
--all
--output
=
backups/latest/file.json
Export all the workflows to a specific directory using the
--backup
flag (details above):
1
n8n
export:workflow
--backup
--output
=
backups/latest/
Credentials
#
Export all your credentials to the standard output (terminal):
1
n8n
export:credentials
--all
Export credentials by their ID and specify the output file name:
1
n8n
export:credentials
--id
=
<ID>
--output
=
file.json
Export all credentials to a specific directory in a single file:
1
n8n
export:credentials
--all
--output
=
backups/latest/file.json
Export all the credentials to a specific directory using the
--backup
flag (details above):
1
n8n
export:credentials
--backup
--output
=
backups/latest/
Export all the credentials in plain text format. You can use this to migrate from one installation to another that has a different secret key in the configuration file.
Sensitive information
All sensitive information is visible in the files.
1
n8n
export:credentials
--all
--decrypted
--output
=
backups/decrypted.json
Import workflows and credentials
#
You can import your workflows and credentials from n8n using the CLI.
Update the IDs
When exporting workflows and credentials, n8n also exports their IDs. If you have workflows and credentials with the same IDs in your existing database, they will be overwritten. To avoid this, delete or change the IDs before importing.
Available flags:
Flag
Description
--help
Help prompt.
--input
Input file name or directory if you use --separate.
--projectId
Import the workflow or credential to the specified project. Can't be used with
--userId
.
--separate
Imports
*.json
files from directory provided by --input.
--userId
Import the workflow or credential to the specified user. Can't be used with
--projectId
.
Migrating to SQLite
n8n limits workflow and credential names to 128 characters, but SQLite doesn't enforce size limits.
This might result in errors like
Data too long for column name
during the import process.
In this case, you can edit the names from the n8n interface and export again, or edit the JSON file directly before importing.
Workflows
#
Import workflows from a specific file:
1
n8n
import:workflow
--input
=
file.json
Import all the workflow files as JSON from the specified directory:
1
n8n
import:workflow
--separate
--input
=
backups/latest/
Credentials
#
Import credentials from a specific file:
1
n8n
import:credentials
--input

file.json
Import all the credentials files as JSON from the specified directory:

import:credentials
--separate
--input
=
backups/latest/
License

Clear your existing license from n8n's database and reset n8n to default features:
1

floating entitlements
, running this command will also attempt to release them back to the pool, making them available for other instances.

User management
