OpenAI Assistant operations
#
Use this operation to create, delete, list, message, or update an assistant in OpenAI. Refer to
OpenAI
for more information on the OpenAI node itself.
Create an Assistant
#
Use this operation to create a new assistant.
Enter these parameters:
Credential to connect with
: Create or select an existing
OpenAI credential
.
Resource
: Select
Assistant
.
Operation
: Select
Create an Assistant
.
Model
: Select the model that the assistant will use. If you’re not sure which model to use, try
gpt-4o
if you need high intelligence or
gpt-4o-mini
if you need the fastest speed and lowest cost. Refer to
Models overview | OpenAI Platform
for more information.
Name
: Enter the name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters.
Description
: Enter the description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters.
1
A virtual assistant that helps users with daily tasks, including setting reminders, answering general questions, and providing quick information.
Instructions
: Enter the system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 32,768 characters. Use this to specify the persona used by the model in its replies.
1
Always respond in a friendly and engaging manner. When a user asks a question, provide a concise answer first, followed by a brief explanation or additional context if necessary. If the question is open-ended, offer a suggestion or ask a clarifying question to guide the conversation. Keep the tone positive and supportive, and avoid technical jargon unless specifically requested by the user.
Code Interpreter
: Turn on to enable the code interpreter for the assistant, where it can write and execute code in a sandbox environment. Enable this tool for tasks that require computations, data analysis, or any logic-based processing.
Knowledge Retrieval
: Turn on to enable knowledge retrieval for the assistant, allowing it to access external sources or a connected knowledge base. Refer to
File Search | OpenAI Platform
for more information.
Files
: Select a file to upload for your external knowledge source. Use
Upload a File
operation to add more files.
Options
#
Output Randomness (Temperature)
: Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between
0.0
(deterministic) and
1.0
(maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or
Output Randomness (Top P)
but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around 0.7) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they’re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. Defaults to
1.0
.
Output Randomness (Top P)
: Adjust the Top P setting to control the diversity of the assistant's responses. For example,
0.5
means half of all likelihood-weighted options are considered. We recommend altering this or
Output Randomness (Temperature)
but not both. Defaults to
1.0
.
Fail if Assistant Already Exists
: If enabled, the operation will fail if an assistant with the same name already exists.
Refer to
Create assistant | OpenAI
documentation for more information.
Delete an Assistant

documentation for more information.
List Assistants
#
Use this operation to retrieve a list of assistants in your organization.
Credential to connect with
: Create or select an existing
OpenAI credential
.
Resource
: Select
Assistant
.
Operation
: Select
List Assistants
.
Options
#
Simplify Output
: Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data. This option is enabled by default.
Refer to
List assistants | OpenAI
documentation for more information.
Message an Assistant
#
Use this operation to send a message to an assistant and receive a response.
Enter these parameters:
Credential to connect with
: Create or select an existing
OpenAI credential
.
Resource
: Select
Assistant
.
Operation
: Select
Message an Assistant
.
Assistant
: Select the assistant you want to message.
Prompt
: Enter the text prompt or message that you want to send to the assistant.
Connected Chat Trigger Node
: Automatically use the input from a previous node's
chatInput
field.
Define Below
: Manually define the prompt by entering static text or using an expression to reference data from previous nodes.
Options
#
Base URL
: Enter the base URL that the assistant should use for making API requests. This option is useful for directing the assistant to use endpoints provided by other LLM providers that offer an OpenAI-compatible API.
Max Retries
: Specify the number of times the assistant should retry an operation in case of failure.
Timeout
: Set the maximum amount of time in milliseconds, that the assistant should wait for a response before timing out. Use this option to prevent long waits during operations.
Preserve Original Tools
: Turn off to remove the original tools associated with the assistant. Use this if you want to temporarily remove tools for this specific operation.
Refer to
Assistants | OpenAI
documentation for more information.
