Change ownership or username
Change instance ownership
#
You can change the ownership of an instance by navigating to the
Settings
page in the owner's account and editing the
Email
field. After making the changes, scroll down and press
Save
.
Note that for the change to be effective, the new email address can't be linked to any other n8n account.
Changing emails will change the owner of the instance, the email you log in with, and the email your invoices and general communication gets sent to.
If the workspace is deactivated, there will be no
Settings
page and no possibility to change the email address or the owner info.
Change instance username
#
It's not currently possible to change usernames.
If you want your instance to have a different name you will need to create a new account and transfer your work into it.
The import/export documentation
explains how you can transfer your work to a new n8n instance.
