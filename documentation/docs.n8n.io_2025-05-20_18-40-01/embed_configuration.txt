Configuration
#
Feature availability
Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to
Embed
on the n8n website.
Authentication
#
You can secure n8n by setting up
User management
, n8n's built-in authentication feature.
n8n supports
LDAP
and
SAML
.
Credential overwrites
#
To offer OAuth login to users, it's possible to overwrite
credentials
on a global basis. This credential data isn't visible to users but the backend uses it automatically.
In the Editor UI, n8n hides all overwritten fields by default. This means that users are able to authenticate using  OAuth by pressing the "connect" button on the credentials.
n8n offers two ways to apply credential overwrites: using Environment Variable and using the REST API.
Using environment variables
#
You can set credential overwrites using environment variable by setting the
CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_DATA
to
{ CREDENTIAL_NAME: { PARAMETER: VALUE }}
.
Warning
Even though this is possible, it isn't recommended. Environment variables aren't protected in n8n, so the data can leak to users.
Using REST APIs
#
The recommended way is to load the data using a custom REST endpoint. Set the
CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT
to a path under which this endpoint should be made available.
Note
The endpoints can be called just one at a time for security reasons.
For example:
Activate the endpoint by setting the environment variable in the environment n8n runs under:
1
export
CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT
=
send-credentials
A JSON file with the credentials to overwrite is then needed. For example, a
oauth-credentials.json
file to overwrite credentials for Asana and GitHub could look like this:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
{
"asanaOAuth2Api"
:
{
"clientId"
:
"<id>"
,
"clientSecret"
:
"<secret>"
},
"githubOAuth2Api"
:
{
"clientId"
:
"<id>"
,
"clientSecret"
:
"<secret>"
}
}
Then apply it to the instance by sending it using curl:
1
curl
-H
"Content-Type: application/json"
--data
@oauth-credentials.json
http://localhost:5678/send-credentials
Note
There are cases when credentials are based on others. For example, the
googleSheetsOAuth2Api
extends the
googleOAuth2Api
.
In this case, you can set parameters on the parent credentials (
googleOAuth2Api
) for all child-credentials (
googleSheetsOAuth2Api
) to use.
Environment variables
#
n8n has many
environment variables
you can configure. Here are the most relevant environment variables for your hosted solution:
Variable
Type
Default
Description
EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT
Number
-1
Sets a default timeout (in seconds) to all workflows after which n8n stops their execution. Users can override this for individual workflows up to the duration set in
EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX
. Set
EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT
to
-1
to disable.
EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE
Boolean
true
Whether to delete data of past executions on a rolling basis.
EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE
Number
336
The execution age (in hours) before it's deleted.
EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT
Number
10000
Maximum number of executions to keep in the database. 0 = no limit
NODES_EXCLUDE
Array of strings
-
Specify which nodes not to load. For example, to block nodes that can be a security risk if users aren't trustworthy:
NODES_EXCLUDE: "[\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\", \"n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile\"]"
NODES_INCLUDE
Array of strings
-
Specify which nodes to load.
N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED
Boolean
true
Enable
workflow templates
(true) or disable (false).
N8N_TEMPLATES_HOST
String
https://api.n8n.io
Change this if creating your own workflow template library. Note that to use your own workflow templates library, your API must provide the same endpoints and response structure as n8n's. Refer to
Workflow templates
for more information.
Backend hooks
#
It's possible to define external hooks that n8n executes whenever a specific operation runs. You can use these, for example, to log data, change data, or forbid an action by throwing an error.
Available hooks
#

Registering hooks
#
Set hooks by registering a hook file that contains the hook functions.
To register a hook, set the environment variable
EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES
.
You can set the variable to a single file:
EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES=/data/hook.js
Or to contain multiple files separated by a semicolon:
EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES=/data/hook1.js;/data/hook2.js
Backend hook files
#
Hook files are regular JavaScript files that have the following format:
1
2
3
4
5

)
{

);
}
}
]
}
}
Backend hook functions
#
A hook or a hook file can contain multiple hook functions, with all functions executed one after another.
If the parameters of the hook function are objects, it's possible to change the data of that parameter to change the behavior of n8n.
You can also access the database in any hook function using
this.dbCollections
(refer to the code sample in
Backend hook files
.
Frontend external hooks
#
Like backend external hooks, it's possible to define external hooks in the frontend code that get executed by n8n whenever a user performs a specific operation. You can use them, for example, to log data and change data.

Registering hooks
#
You can set hooks by loading the hooks script on the page. One way to do this is by creating a hooks file in the project and adding a script tag in your
editor-ui/public/index.html
file:
1
<
script
src
=
"frontend-hooks.js"
></
script
>

Frontend hook functions
#
You can define multiple hook functions per hook. Each hook function is invoked with the following arguments arguments:
store
: The Vuex store object. You can use this to change or get data from the store.
metadata
: The object that contains any data provided by the hook. To see what's passed, search for the hook in the
editor-ui
package.
