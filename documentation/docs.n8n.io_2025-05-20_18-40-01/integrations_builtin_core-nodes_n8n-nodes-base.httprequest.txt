HTTP Request node
#
The HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes in n8n. It allows you to make HTTP requests to query data from any app or service with a REST API. You can use the HTTP Request node a regular node or attached to an
AI agent
to use as a
tool
.
When using this node, you're creating a REST API call. You need some understanding of basic API terminology and concepts.
There are two ways to create an HTTP request: configure the
node parameters
or
import a curl command
.
Credentials
Refer to
HTTP Request credentials
for guidance on setting up authentication.
Node parameters
#
Method
#
Select the method to use for the request:
DELETE
GET
HEAD
OPTIONS
PATCH

PUT
URL
#
Enter the endpoint you want to use.
Authentication
#
n8n recommends using the
Predefined Credential Type
option when it's available. It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.
Predefined credentials
#
Credentials for integrations supported by n8n, including both built-in and community nodes. Use
Predefined Credential Type
for custom operations without extra setup. Refer to
Custom API operations
for more information.
Generic credentials
#
Credentials for integrations not supported by n8n. You'll need to manually configure the authentication process, including specifying the required API endpoints, necessary parameters, and the authentication method.
You can select one of the following methods:
Basic auth
Custom auth
Digest auth
Header auth
OAuth1 API
OAuth2 API
Query auth
Refer to
HTTP request credentials
for more information on setting up each credential type.

Pagination
#
Use this option to paginate results, useful for handling query results that are too big for the API to return in a single call.
Inspect the API data first
Some options for pagination require knowledge of the data returned by the API you're using. Before setting up pagination, either check the API documentation, or do an API call without pagination, to see the data it returns.
Understand pagination
Pagination means splitting a large set of data into multiple pages. The amount of data on each page depends on the limit you set.
For example, you make an API call to an endpoint called
/users
. The API wants to send back information on 300 users, but this is too much data for the API to send in one response.
If the API supports pagination, you can incrementally fetch the data. To do this, you call
/users
with a pagination limit, and a page number or URL to tell the API which page to send. In this example, say you use a limit of 10, and start from page 0. The API sends the first 10 users in its response. You then call the API again, increasing the page number by 1, to get the next 10 results.
Configure the pagination settings:
Pagination Mode
:
Off
: Turn off pagination.
Update a Parameter in Each Request
: Use this when you need to dynamically set parameters for each request.
Response Contains Next URL
: Use this when the API response includes the URL of the next page. Use an expression to set
Next URL
.
For example setups, refer to
HTTP Request node cookbook | Pagination
.
n8n provides built-in variables for working with HTTP node requests and responses when using pagination:
Variable
Description
$pageCount
The pagination count. Tracks how many pages the node has fetched.
$request
The request object sent by the HTTP node.
$response
The response object from the HTTP call. Includes
$response.body
,
$response.headers
, and
$response.statusCode
. The contents of
body
and
headers
depend on the data sent by the API.
API differences
Different APIs implement pagination in different ways. Check the API documentation for the API you're using for details. You need to find out things like:
Does the API provide the URL for the next page?
Are there API-specific limits on page size or page number?
The structure of the data that the API returns.
Proxy
#
Use this option if you need to specify an HTTP proxy.
Enter the
Proxy
the request should use.
Timeout
#
Use this option to set how long the node should wait for the server to send response headers (and start the response body). The node aborts requests that exceed this value for the initial response.
Enter the
Timeout
time to wait in milliseconds.
Tool-only options
#
The following options are only available when attached to an
AI agent
as a
tool
.
Optimize Response
#
Whether to optimize the tool response to reduce the amount of data passed to the LLM. Optimizing the response can reduce costs and can help the LLM ignore unimportant details, often leading to better results.
When optimizing responses, you select an expected response type, which determines other options you can configure. The supported response types are:
JSON
#
When expecting a
JSON
response, you can configure which parts of the JSON data to use as a response with the following choices:
Field Containing Data
: This field identifies a specific part of the JSON object that contains your relevant data. You can leave this blank to use the entire response.
Include Fields
: This is how you choose which fields you want in your response object. There are three choices:
All
: Include all fields in the response object.
Selected
: Include only the fields specified below.
Fields
: A comma-separated list of fields to include in the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.
Exclude
: Include all fields
except
the fields specified below.
Fields
: A comma-separated list of fields to exclude from the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.
HTML
#
When expecting
HTML
, you can identify the part of an HTML document relevant to the LLM and optimize the response with the following options:
Selector (CSS)
: A specific element or element type to include in the response HTML. Uses the
body
element by default.
Return Only Content
: Whether to strip HTML tags and attributes from the response, leaving only the actual content. This uses fewer tokens and may be easier for the model to understand.
Elements To Omit
: A comma-separated list of CSS selectors to exclude when extracting content.
Truncate Response
: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.
Max Response Characters
: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.
Text
#
When expecting a generic
Text
response, you can optimize the results with the following options:
Truncate Response
: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.
Max Response Characters
: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.
Import curl command
#
curl
is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.
You can use curl to call REST APIs. If the API documentation of the service you want to use provides curl examples, you can copy them out of the documentation and into n8n to configure the HTTP Request node.
Import a curl command:
From the HTTP Request node's
Parameters
tab, select
Import cURL
. The
Import cURL command
modal opens.
Paste your curl command into the text box.
Select
Import
. n8n loads the request configuration into the node fields. This overwrites any existing configuration.
