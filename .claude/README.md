# Claude Code Configuration

This directory contains shared Claude Code configuration for the n8n team.

## Setup

### Linear MCP Server

The Linear MCP server uses OAuth authentication. To connect:

1. Start Claude Code in this repository
2. Run `/mcp` command
3. Click the Linear authentication link in your browser
4. Authorize with your Linear account

You only need to do this once per machine.

### Permissions

Configure tool permissions in your global Claude Code settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`), not in this repo. This allows each developer to customize their own approval preferences.

To auto-approve Linear MCP tools, add to your global settings:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "mcp__linear-server__*"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Note:** For GitHub/git operations, we use `gh` CLI and `git` commands instead of GitHub MCP.

## Available Commands

- `/n8n-triage PAY-XXX` - Analyze and triage a Linear issue
- `/n8n-plan PAY-XXX` - Create implementation plan

## Quick Reference

- `/n8n-conventions` - Load detailed conventions guide (optional - agents already know n8n patterns)

## Workflow

**Recommended approach:**
1. `/n8n-triage PAY-123` → Investigate root cause and severity (optional)
2. `/n8n-plan PAY-123` → Create detailed implementation plan
3. Review the plan in chat
4. Say "implement it" or "go ahead" → I'll launch n8n-developer agent
5. Implementation proceeds with full context from the plan

## Agents

- **n8n-developer** - Full-stack n8n development (frontend/backend/nodes)
- **n8n-linear-issue-triager** - Issue investigation and analysis

## Skills

- **n8n-conventions** - 313-line reference guide (optional - agents have embedded knowledge)
  - Use `/n8n-conventions` when you need detailed patterns
  - Not auto-loaded to save tokens (~6-8K)
